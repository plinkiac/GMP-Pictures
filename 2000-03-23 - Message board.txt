Fresh Start - MIKE 3/23/2000, 4:01 am (archive.ph/MtCOk)
  I have deleted all the messages on this board in an attempt to wipe away this awful chapter in GMP history.
  Let's try and keep personal opnions to ourselves this time and only post stuff that has to do with GMP projects, amature movies in general, or anything else that's remotely relevant to this board.
  Thus will bloom a new age of peace and prosperity!

What's going on? - E of Ex 4/3/2000, 12:34 pm (archive.ph/04SX2)
  I was just wondering what's going on in the world of GMP and is this site going to be updated?
  Also when are the rewind awards nominations going to be decided?
  I just love Dan O. in that fine movie Jester.
  "Anywhere baaa - UT! the grrrrooondddddd (laughing).

violence fest 2000 - Ron Kosary 4/10/2000, 11:10 pm (archive.ph/urEyb)
  With the much anticipated release of the new orange movie, I wonder what insanely violent movies GMP will unleash this summer season?
  I love violence and cannot get enough blood.
  A new Star Wars travesty is the wave of the future.
  What happens when a couple of jedi knights are very tired from being sent around the universe solving so many of the republic's stupid problems?
  They kill everything in view in the name of piece.
  Overwhelmed with too many assignments on a call one day to the far reaches of space, the first Jedi Knight totally loses his bearings with reality and easily falls within the clutches of the insane side of the force.
  Although not exactly the dark side, this insane side is the aggregation of all frustration generated by living creatures throughout time and space.
  The other jedi might have ended up all right if it had not been for the insane jedi's impressionable view about life the universe and everything, which seemed completely rational after not having slept in several days.
  Many twisted thoughts mutually enter both jedi minds.
  Everything/one is a threat to the republic and must be stopped.
  Just ask some of their many helpless victims this pondering question: How could something so good inflict so much friggin' pain?

Can't wait to see what GMP has next . . . - Derek M. Koch 4/13/2000, 11:40 pm
