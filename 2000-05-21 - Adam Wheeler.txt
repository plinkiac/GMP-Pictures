Adam Wheeler joined the company less than a year ago and he's already making no impact! Adam's very first role was Boris in White Thugz, which he did a fine job at.
I really had no one else to play the part, but Adam did just a fine and acceptable job, though I think he said he sucked at it, but I'm not sure.
Though all of Adam's performances can be counted on one hand he is quickly gaining fame and fourtune as one of GMP's highly respected drones.
In all honesty, Adam has helped out a lot and would always be there when you need him - for which I am grateful.
He was suppsed to be the production assistant on my first failed Tech 2 film, but got lumped into a role wearing a costume in the freezing winter, he complained, but you would have too.
Adam did some behind the scenes filming for the produciton of Oranges 5 as well as some puppetearing.
He also had the most roles in Blunt Justice playing: Gang Member #1, Guy with crutches, Riot Cop, Alien Council member, and someone else.
Adam also did a good job in the Random Foo parodies, playing multiple roles there as well.
He will be appearing in the next films as well.
Adam currently attends Columbia College and is moving to Colorado at the start of the summer.
