NANNOO:
I don't know, I just knew it was gonna cut me today.
I don't know, I just knew it was gonna cut me today.
Oh, well, I got Tums and things for ya.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I got everything you need.
Oh, well, I got Tums and things for ya.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I got everything you need.
Yeah, don't you like that?
And I know you'd love 'em.
Oh, well, I got Tums and things for ya.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I got everything you need.
Aren't those good?
And I know you'd love 'em.
And I know you'd love 'em.
And I know you'd love 'em.

RICH:
Ah, I'm sweaty, and then I get itchy, and I'm gonna keep itching, because it itches, and then my face is gonna get fucking sore.
Where's the monkey head?

MIKE:
It's in the living room.

RICH:
Are you ready to cut me out of this thing?

MIKE:
Used as a, as a Jenga.

RICH:
Jenga doesn't have...

MIKE:
What did you forget?

RICH:
Gloves.

MIKE:
Oh, fuck.
Gotta be in that room, unless you took 'em off.
God damn, it's hot in here.

RICH:
I should hit you.

MIKE:
I wonder what it's like to be in an ape costume.
I'm just in a t-shirt and I'm sweating.

RICH:
Oh, you have it so awful.

MIKE:
I'm hot.
I wanna get this done.
Think of what Danny DeVito went through in The Pilgrim.
Okay?
Just think about that.

RICH:
The what?

MIKE:
I dunno.
Think about what Chevy Chase went through in Funny Farm, and use those as inspiration.

RICH:
I'm sure Chevy Chase had an air conditioned trailer.
I have a sweaty monkey glove.

MIKE:
How long does it take to get a glove on?

RICH:
Mike!
Do you have any idea how hot I am right now?

MIKE:
Then...

RICH:
Shut up, and let me take my time getting this glove on for your stupid monkey man project.
I don't even have the energy right now to swing this fucking shovel.

MIKE:
You don't...

RICH:
I'm dizzy.
Shut up.

MIKE:
You don't have to swing the shovel.

RICH:
Film.

MIKE:
Just break that shit.

RICH:
Film!

MIKE:
Action.
Why, what happened?

RICH:
It broke in half.

MIKE:
I can cut that.
Rip that thing off.
Get it off.

RICH:
Get, you gotta cut it in the back.
There's too much tape.

MIKE:
Oh, shit.
Here, I could use this.
Dammit.

RICH:
Just do it quick!

MIKE:
I'm getting...hold on.
Ugh.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Almost out of it.
It's caught on the fur.
Hold on.
You're almost out of it.
Okay, there you go.
Now, go, go.

RICH:
Close the door behind you shut.
I worked eight-and-a-half hours today, and then I come home, and I sweat to death.
Very grouchy right now.
Did you see?

MIKE:
What was that?

RICH:
This flew out and hit me right here.

MIKE:
It hit you...

RICH:
I almost seriously said, "Ow, my groin."
I hate this sound.
It's the sound of this piano dying.
That worked rather well.

MIKE:
There you go.
The beauty of music.
You know, there's something oddly poetic about playing a piano with a crowbar.

MIKE:
What do you call your piece?

RICH:
Sin.
Uh, are you gonna help?

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Well, we gotta do this, we gotta get it downstairs, right?

RICH:
Pretty much, outside the front door, would be nice.

MIKE:
Okay.
Like, on the porch?

RICH:
Yeah.
I'll accept porch.

MIKE:
Let's do it then.

RICH:
Right now?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Why not?
No time like the present.

RICH:
All right.

MIKE:
Every second that ticks away is a second of your life that you'll never get back.

RICH:
Do you realize this piano has been in my life for as long as I can possibly remember?
Since I was a wee child.
Let's get the chunks off.
Where's the monkey mask?
Help me, let's get it down there.
So it ends.
Just, like...
Fucking white people.
Y'all is some crazy mother fuckers.
White meat people.
Serial killers, people eat mother fuckers.
Shit.

MIKE:
So, uh, Rich, is this a, a metaphor?

RICH:
No.
It's a piano.
