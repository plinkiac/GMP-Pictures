Gee, honey.
I don't feel too safe with all that nuclear testing they've been doing around the base lately.
Why, don't be silly, honey.
Nuclear power is the most cleanest, efficient source of energy we have today.
It'll revolutionize the world.
A friend to you and me.
Oh, really?
What about that accident I heard about the other day?
What was that?
Well, sometimes, honey, sacrifices must be made for the sake of progress.
It's a terrible tragedy what happened to Carl Nyaagher being at ground zero at that testing bombing.
But, hey, I've got a surprise coming for you this Valentine's Day.
Oh, wow.
Our life is so perfect together.
Nothing can ever go wrong.
You can say that again, hun.
We have the best life ever, honey.
Nyaagh.
What?
Did you say something dear?
Nyaagh!
Nyaagh...
Did you hear that?
I'm sure it was nothing.
Gee, it sure is a shame they never found Carl Nyaagher's body at the test site.
Nyaagh.
I think the kids are acting up again.
No, that wasn't the children.
We don't have any yet.
Nyaagh!
Honey, keep it down.
I'm trying to read the sports page.
Nyaagh!
Goddammit, hun.
Do I have to give you a beating?
I'm hearing noises outside.
Nyaagh!
I think we need to get the pipes checked.
They're making strange funny noises.
Nyaagh...
That's right, hun.
I love you, too.
Yes, yes.
Nyaagh!
What?
Oh, oh, aughhhh!
Nyaagh!
Nyaaghh...
No!
I landed on your goddamn scissors.
God, somebody pull them out!
No, now your piano's stuck in my head.
Nyaagh!
Oh, gosh.
Irene, Irene, are you okay?
Oh, oh god, no, he's coming towards me.
Oh, Jesus Christ, he's hitting me with my own door.
Oh, my door.
Oh, my fucking door!
Nyaagh...nyaagh!
Nyaaghhh!
Ow!
A sewing machine, a piano, a television set, my chair, and a door are all stuck in my fucking head.
Nyaagh.
Oh, Irene.
Irene, where are you?
