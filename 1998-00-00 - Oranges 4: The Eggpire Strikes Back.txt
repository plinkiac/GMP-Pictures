Oranges 4: The Eggpire Strikes Back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD9NNAVWBGA

Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Relax.
You must analyze the situation rationally.
Wisdom is divine.
Okay, sir.
currently, several egg-shaped vehicles are, are landing on our planet even as we speak.
Now, it's my belief that they've come here to, uh, give us gifts and shower us with technology and lead us to a golden age of enlightenment.
Sir, I would be forced to disagree with his opinion.
Both of their eggcrafts have guns.
And they've already attacked three major cities and taken millions of hostages.
Uh, nobody's perfect.
Sir, as a representative of the families, I personally recruited several men to help us take care of the situation.
No, no, no.
We're only going to use our Orange Forces on this one.
No outside help.
Well, sir, I have personally went through the trouble to recruit two men of my own.
Why, it's Hulk Hogan and David Hasselhoff!
Yeah, I pity the egg that messes with me!
Where's Jay Leno?
Where's The Tonight Show?
No, no, no!
Don't you all see what this is?
Why, why this is a very attack at the very heart of the Oranges!
They', they're going after our own homeworld now!
Why, there's nothing else we can do but to stand up amongst ourselves, to send a message to stand for Orange unity!
Why, why, I say when we are threatened, we must unite ourselves to take care of this problem.
We, we don't need anyone outside of us.
We are Oranges, we are strong!
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
We should assemble a very large strike force and violently attack them.
Hear, hear!
Now that's a plan if I've ever heard one.
Base One to Command, Base One to Command, General McCaggot here.
Prepare all forces for a massive invasion.
Have all units take their guns and shoot them in every direction in hopes of hitting something.
We are about to be invaded.
Those eggs are coming, everyone.
So let's get cracking!
Mighty fine day for a war, isn't it?
No day is good for a war.
Unless it's Monday through Friday.
This is General McCaggot to all troops.
Prepare to engage the enemy.
Commander Asmar?
Yes, sir?
Assemble your troops.
It'ss time to attack.
Yes!
It is time.
Begin your attack!
Aw, shit!
An explosive shell!
Corgi, are you alright?
Ohh...I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Oh, man.
Medic, medic!!
War is going pretty well, actually.
We've only lost 50% of our...oh my lord, there's a child on the battlefield!
General, get that child off the battlefield.
Fire all weapons on him.
Look, kid.
We have to get off of this battlefield now.
The most terrible thing--
I lost my mommy.
I don't care about your mommy right now.
Let's go.
Which way's my mommy?
She's gone.
Your mommy's probably dead in the bloody battle.
Oh, god.
Oh, my.
I thought that grass looked awfully phony.
I guess that means we're captured.
Oh, no.
Where's my mommy?
What's going on here?
I demand you let us out of this cage immediately.
Who's in charge of this operation?
Be quiet!
I'm scared, Mr.
Sunkyst.
What are they going to do with us?
We're all scared.
They're probably going to do terrible experiments on us.
horrendous stuff.
They're going to probably flay our skin, and leave us there to die or something.
Horrible Nazi-like experiments, I'm sure.
But that's okay.
Be brave, we're all oranges here, and I'm sure we can make it through this if they don't kill us.
I'm scared, Mr.Sunkyst.
My mommy wants me home soon.
Shut up, kid.
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be in this mess.
I think we're d-ughhhh!
Give 'em hell, boys!
Give 'em hell!
Okay, boys.
You heard the sarge.
Kill 'em real good!
Everybody, fire your guns!
It's on fire, auughhh!
N6N4, report to shell maintenance.
Yeah, so, uh, what's your name?
Have you been working here long, baby?
You, there.
Get back to work.
Oh, my god.
I'm scared.
Professor Wimplesticks, I don't wanna be dipped into that stuff.
I'm real frightened.
Bring in the next four prisoners.
Don't worry, now.
I'm sure our strike force will get here any minute, and they'll blow apart this whole place.
We'll be saved.
Just wait and see.
Keep working, eggs.
I don't know, I'm terrified.
Calm down, Claudia.
Calm down.
Oh, my god.
Who's that?
It's you, Emperor Rabbit, also known as...the Easter Bunny!
Yes, that's correct.
There's nothing you can do to stop me now.
My invasion of the Orange homeworld is nearly complete.
What are you doing to us?
Why are we hooked up to these godawful machines?
You Oranges, uh, you need so much.
You Oranges, your pathetic identity.
Even your color, your name!
Orange!
Everything's orange!
Orange!
Well, I intend to put a stop to that.
The only way to truly defeat you, to recite your very wills, is to change your color.
You may say it's hopeless.
You may say that we don't have a chance, but we're Oranges, and Oranges never quit!
Through and through, we will always be Orange, even though I'm starting to turn a putrid brown.
Must be a dud.
Oh, god.
I think I soiled myself.
Sir, sir!
Our intelligence division has just discovered that Professor Sunkyst has attacked us.
What are these, these horrible machines you have us strapped in?
What are they doing?
I demand you tell me right now.
I brought in a good friend of your to facilitate the process.
As a matter of fact, he designed the whole thing.
Perhaps you remember him...from college?
Oh.
What have you done to my laboratory?
It's a complete mess.
Oh, I consider the setup to be quite logical.
Dr. Eggbert, my other ex-college roommate!
Professor Sunkyst?
Why, I never expected to see you hear.
What do you expect, you monster.
This is the Orange homeworld.
"Monster", me?
I'm just applying my scientific knowledge for the good of the Eggpire.
Your, your precious Eggpire is evil.
What other kind of organization would be headed by a deranged bunny with a sinister laugh?
What you consider to be evil or not is irrelevant.
I'm in this for the science.
Evil is logical.
Why, just what do you intend to do to us with your, your science?
Well, then.
I'm glad that you asked.
As you can see, I have developed an Easter egg dye/mind control chemical.
The terribly complicated device that all of you are hanging from will slowly dip you into one of the chemicals.
It will change your natural orange color to that of one of friendly Easter-friendly colors.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I also failed to mention it will drain any of your free will.
You'll become a slave to the Eggpire.
Oh, I just love my scientific work.
Enough talking.
Begin the dipping process.
And get back to work.
Begin the dipping process.
Oh, no.
I can't bear to watch.
I don't wanna be green!
I don't wanna be--
Oh!
Oh, the horror!
The horror!
How are the chemical infusions coming?
Report!
All systems, how are they function?
Dipping process complete.
I serve the Eggpire.
Why, why, why look what you've done to him!
He, he's not an orange anymore!
Why, he's nothing more than a, than a, a Green!
The war is going well.
We're having more prisoners come in by the minute.
Increase the productivity to three Oranges converted at a time.
But Emperor Rabbit, in order to dip three at a time, we'll have to recalibrate all of the equipment.
It, it could take some time.
Very well.
Proceed.
Somebody get me a carrot.
General, sir.
Captain Asmar, here.
Yes, Captain Asmar, we're losing too many troops.
I want you to go out there personally.
What.
Yeah, you heard me.
Go out there personally.
Go.
Oh!
Sir.
They've broken through our last line of defense.
What!
Get set, Kamikaze Eggs.
Prepare to jump!
I got you!
Come here, come here!
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, Eggbert.
Why are you doing this?
Is science the only thing that matters to you?
What about all those great times we had together in college?
The beanbag races.
The online poker marathons.
Even that time we went to that Star Trek convention.
Doesn't this mean anything to you?
Yes, I remember those.
Those were all very good times and all, but, but my work is to science now.
I have to put these frivolous feelings behind me.
My chemicals are what matter now.
Continue with your work.
No, no, wait, wait.
What about that time I snuck into your house one night, and had my way with your sister?
What?
The calibrations are complete.
Begin the process.
Please, no, don't do this.
Don't do this to me.
Oh, my lord!
This is the end of me.
The beauty pagaent I was supposed to be in.
Oh, darn.
Oh--
Oh, no!
Fuck that.
I'll make them an offer they can't refuse.
Fire the nuclear weapons.
Oh, my god, ow!
Oh!
Oh, my god, ow!
Oh, oh!
Janet, you're gonna have to go on.
Your heart will go on.
No, Jack.
Yes, yes!
You're gonna live to be a ripe old age, and you're gonna live to have dozens of little eggs.
You're gonna have a dozen of 'em.
Oh!
No, Jack.
I won't leave you!
You must!
Save yourself!
I'll never let go, Jack.
I'll never let go.
Watch out for that other robot.
What other, what other robot?
Right there, look up!
What, there's a robot above me?
Yep!
What robot?
I don't see any robot.
Jump...oh, my g--
Get off me, you cretins.
All I'd to do is make a couple phone calls.
Get rid of most of ya.
Ow, stop biting at my face.
We all must get outta here.
Get back to work!
Live long, and prosper.
Oh, god, get back to work!
Oh, Claudia.
It's you.
I'm glad to see you're okay.
I couldn't find anyone else.
There was fire everywhere.
Now, don't worry, hun.
I'm sure some of us will turn out okay.
Although it's hard to tell with all this carnage flying around.
It maybe years before we've calculated all the detahs.
Oh, my god.
My children...I have to go find them!
Okay, you go find your children, I've got some scores to settle!
Oh, oh no!
Has anyone see Eggbert?
Where is Eggbert?
Oh, no.
I hope he didn't die in that, that terrible explosion.
Emperor Rabbit!
I am, look at me, I'm covered in my own mind control juice, I, I serve my own Eggpire, I'm going to kill you, Professor Sunkyst, aughhhhhhh!
Look, there's Eggbert!
And he's got a match!
Oh, my god!
Oh, it's horrible!
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Aughhh!
I won't watch this terrible sighting.
Aughhh!
Oh, my god!
Aughhh!
The bunny, the bunny.
It's burning.
It's, it's beautiful.
Aughhh!
Ow, my face, my face, the smile is--
Ow!
No!
Why, why Eggbert, you saved the day!
Oranges everywhere owe you a great debt of gratitude.
Oh, I guess it wasn't that big of a deal.
I just couldn't stand by and let Emperor Brabbit destroy the beautiful Orange homeworld.
Why, with this luscious green astroturf, and all.
Hey, Professor Sunkyst.
I picked these flowers just for you.
Oh, oh, why, thank you, Claudia.
You know, these flowers, they represent the blooming of a new age of peace for the Orange people.
I, I envision a joyous time of prosperity, and joyfulness for all.
Even children.
Sir, sir, there are ships approaching.
We're being invaded...again!
Hot damn.
Everyone, pick a gun up from a bloody carcass.
We're gonna kill every last one of those motherfuckers.
Get them.
Kill them all!
