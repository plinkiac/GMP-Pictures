DAVID ASHE:
If someone had corn on the cob for breakfast, and then took a shit, the little chunks of the corn would still be in their shit, right?
You'd have the log.
Inside the log would be kernels of corn.
Undigested.
That was their breakfast.
Now let's suppose you go over to this piece of shit and pick out the kernels of corn and eat them yourself.
Did you eat their breakfast?
What the fuck is that?
What's the fucking answer for that?
How the fuck are you supposed to live when you can eat someone else's breakfast?
I'm tired.

JAY:
You do realize this is gonna be the worst thing ever made here, right?

TALL MAN WITH GLASSES (MARC LINN?):
Is it a Ghostbusted 2?
Yeah?

GARRETT:
Action.

MAN WITH GOATEE:
The ending credits come up, and the first thing that starts off is it's a picture of me.
And I go, and I go, and I go, and I go,
"Look out!"
"Ghost!"
Like that, right?
And then, and then, like -- BOOM! -- the main title comes up on the screen.
The movie starts with me explaining how to start the movie.
And then you cut the thing that I explained about.

DAVID ASHE:
So, like, what we're talking about right now is gonna be the movie?

MAN WITH GOATEE:
This...

DAVID ASHE:
Our conversation is the fucking movie!
That's fucking brilliant!
I'm taking off my pants.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my fucking god.

JAY:
You know, Lisa?
It's really great being here in South Dakota	and everything for this festival.
But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I really really wanna kill a man.
I've never done it before.
I mean, surprising, I've never done it before.

LISA:
You wanna kill someone?

JAY:
Yeah, I mean...

LISA:
A man...
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah, a man.
Not a woman.

LISA:
Jay, where is this coming from?
Nowhere?
I mean, I have stange fantasies and illusions, too.
But I don't tell everyone I wanna hug an elephant.
And I do, but...

JAY:
You wanna hug an elephant?

LISA:
Let's get back to you wanna kill a man, Jay?

JAY:
I mean, I'd like to kill a man.
It's just...

LISA:
Really?

JAY:
Oh.
Hi.

MIKE:
Hi.

JAY:
What's going on?

MIKE:
Oh.
I changed my name to Albert.

JAY:
Albert?
What made you decide to do that?
But it was still...

MIKE:
I changed my last name, Albert, to Finney.

LISA:
Albert Finney?

MIKE:
I was in the bathroom, and I saw a ghost.

JAY:
Seriously?

LISA:
Oh, this is, this is great.
This is great.

MIKE:
I've been going around telling everybody not to use that particular restroom.

LISA:
Yep.

JAY:
I mean...

MIKE:
Well, I haven't been in the other restrooms.

LISA:
Would it, would it...
Was it a he?
Was it a she?
What did it look like?

JAY:
Did you get...
Yeah, what did it look like?

MIKE:
Well...
It was kind of androgynous.
It was like, uh, you know, with the, with the...

JAY:
Like Dennis Rodman?
Like, you don't know what's going on up there.

MIKE:
No, but it didn't look like Dennis Rodman.
It looked like a quivering, uh, mass of tentacles and glowing energy...

JAY:
You know, Mike?
I'm gonna be honest with you here.
I mean, it's, it's great to see you and everything.
Or, Albert.
I'm sorry.

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
But we, we kind of were having an important conversation before you came in.

MIKE:
Oh!

JAY:
Kind of interrupting something here.

MIKE:
Um, well...

LISA:
No, he's not.

JAY:
No, he is.

LISA:
Why don't you tell him what you wanna do, Jay?

JAY:
Oh, okay.
Well, here's the thing.
I, I really really want to kill a man.
Can you understand that?

MIKE:
A man, or...

LISA:
Listen to this.

JAY:
A man.

MIKE:
Well, who?

JAY:
I don't really know yet.

LISA:
Does that really matter?
He wants to kill a man.

MIKE:
Well, it does matter.

LISA:
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
If it's some guy from China, I don't care.

LISA:
Okay.

MIKE:
If it's someone from China...

JAY:
Wait, wait.
China.
You, what do you got against the Chinese?

MIKE:
Nothing.
There's just a lot of 'em.
If it's some guy...

JAY:
Well, I don't...

LISA:
What if it's you, Albert?
Is it okay then?
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, then I'd, I'd be, I'd be very interested knowing.
 
JAY:
Yeah.
It's a good thing it's not you that I wanna kill.

MIKE:
Oh.
Listen, I just came to warn you guys.

JAY:
Well, I really appreciate that.

LISA:
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

JAY:
And it's, you know, I really appreciate that you come to us first.

MIKE:
Let me tell you.
You know when you go down...

LISA:
Warn us from the tentacle...
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.

JAY:
So it's a really good thing that I don't wanna murder you.

LISA:
Thanks, Mike.
Albert.

JAY:
Because if I wanted to murder you, then, then I feel bad that you just came in and, and told us this information and warned us when the fact is, all I wanna do is kill you.
That'd be, I, I'd be coming off like an asshole, you know?
So that's...
It's a good thing that's not the case.
Are you all right?
What was that?

LISA:
Is that...
Are you okay?

MIKE:
What was what?

JAY:
What you just did.
What was that?
You, you did a little jerk movement, like...

LISA:
You did a little, like, spastic...

JAY:
It looked like someone, you know, hooked a car battery up to your testicles.

MIKE:
Holy shit.
