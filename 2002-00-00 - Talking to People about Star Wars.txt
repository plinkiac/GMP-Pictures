GARRETT:
Tell me about Star Wars, Rich.

RICH:
Oh, where to begin?

["A long, long time ago"]

JOHN:
Action? You don't say action where you're asking people about Star Wars.

GARRETT:
Yes, you do.

JOHN:
Oh.

["Naboo was under an attack"]

["And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn"]

JAY:
I can't think of anything clever to say,because I'm tired.

["...into maybe cutting them a little slack"]

JOHN:
And, at such a per-, oh, are you feeding me my lines now?

["But their response, it didn't thrill us"]

["They locked the doors and tried to kill us"]

["We escaped from that gas"]

["Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass"]

["We took a bongo from the scene"]

GARRETT:
Uh, this is an interview about Star Wars. What is Star Wars?

JAY:
What is it?

GARRETT:
Yeah.

JAY:
You mean, to me, or just in general?

GARRETT:
Either.

JAY:
Um, it's a lot of, a lot of bullshit.

GARRETT:
Really? Star Wars is a lot of bullshit?

JAY:
Ehh...

GARRETT:
Why? Uh, are you a Star Wars fan?

JAY:
I, I was a Star Wars fan, and I just got really tired of it after a while.

RICH:
I don't really care anymore.

GARRETT:
Why not?

RICH:
Um, well, a combination of, uh, this prequel stuff just offending me on many levels.

GARRETT:
It offends you?

RICH:
It offends me by, by just being horrible, and being thrown in my face. And I think Star Wars in general, Phantom Menace or no, is just grossly overexposed.

GARRETT:
Overrated, or just overexposed?

RICH:
Overexposed. Overexposed. Not overrated. I thiink the original trilogy is brilliant. Very brilliant.

LISA:
Yeah, it is.

GARRETT:
Yeah, exactly.

LISA:
Okay.

GARRETT:
Are you a Star Wars fan?

LISA:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Why are you a Star Wars fan?

LISA:
Why am I a Star Wars fan? Um, um...there's gonna be a long pause here while I think.

GARRETT:
I think most people are questioning their Star Wars fandom at this point.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I used to be. And I'm not sure anymore. Kind of like a, an agnostic. I question the existence of Star Wars.

GARRETT:
Are you a Star Wars fan?

JESSE:
Yes, yes I am. 

GARRETT:
How long have you been a Star Wars fan?

JESSE:
Um, gosh, pretty long time. As long as I can remember, I'd say.

GARRETT:
Are you looking forward to, uh, Attack of the Clones?

JESSE:
Yeah. Yes, I am. Whether I'm embarrassed to say so, but...

GARRETT:
You, you're admitting. That's great.

JESSE:
I'm admitting it. I, I, I, I, you know, as much as I'd love to suppress, I go along with the mass populace. I'm actually, uh, relatively, relatively excited about it, just because, just because, I know it's not gonna be good, but I'm still gonna, like, I'm still gonna have fun, it's still gonna be a joy, and it's, it's, you know...

GARRETT:
Because it's Star Wars?

JESSE:
Because it's, because there are light sabers in it and...that's all I care about anymore. That's all the new trilogy has going for it.

RICH:
During the 80's, it was cool to like Star Wars. You had a lot of 20-something-year olds running around, you know, discussing the, the merits of the Death Star and how great Han Solo was as a character.

GARRETT:
Would people get on you for this if they...

JESSE:
Oh, yeah, some of them, yes, I...I know Jay would be, like, shaking his head. But whatever dude, it's gonna, it's, I'm still gonna have fun. I know, it can be total shit, and I'd, I'd, I mean, I'm gonna buy it. I'm gonna set it on my shelf. I'm gonna watch it probably, like, once a month or something.

GARRETT:
Uh, you were a Star Wars fan as a kid.

DAVID:
Um, I don't, I, probably not possible that anyone could have been more a Star Wars than I was as a kid. I mean, no, that's not true. I mean, I wasn't incredibly hardcore, like, collecting all the toys, buying all sorts of merchandise. But I did have toys. I watched the movies regularly. Um, when the video game, X-Wing, came out for PC, it was my life. X-Wing vs TIE Fighter was revamped for X-Wing Alliance, the final say in X-Wing games, in which you could fly as all sorts of ships, fight in superior Starl Destroyers, it was incredible. You could make your own missions. I was in heaven there.

JOHN:
It doesn't, I don't know if it really irks me, but it just sort of confuses me that people are actually able to view this Star Wars movies as movies. I mean, the Star Wars movies have such a, are sort of integral part of the culture, and such an integral part of, I mean, my childhood.

DAVID:
I really love the Star Wars story. To me, it is the quintessential drama.

JOHN:
I can't distinctly remember the first time I saw Star Wars, and it was this great moment and, or anything like that. I can't, I can't even distinctly remember a time when I watched Star Wars. But I know that I watched it so many countless times that, I mean, I mean, everyone of, of my generation just sort of knows those movies back-to-front. It's sort of, it's a given, you know? Except for maybe girls.

GARRETT:
Girls?

JOHN:
Girls don't know Star Wars.

LISA:I guess it's gonna be the same thing everybody says about, like, when I was little, I, like, fell in love with the characters and the story, and, like, there's just, like, such a cool world that, like, I wanted to be a part of. And, like, the new movies, I'm not such a big fan of.

MIKE:
I question whether or not George Lucas is in charge of his own mind anymore. Whether or not the Star Wars, uh, operation is merely a big hack-job used to sell merchandise, or if it's an actual vision that he wants to commit to film, or he just wants to sell plastic Jar Jar Binks dolls.

GARRETT:
Which side are you leaning on?

MIKE:
The plastic Jar Jar Binks dolls side.

RICH:
You have the, the Special Editions. I didn't mind these. I know they've fucked with them, but it's just nice seeing them on the big screen. But, with that, you had the, this marketing blitz that was just insane. You'd walk into a toy store and you'd, uh, see nothing but seas of that, that, uh, orange and green cardboard boxes they had. You'd walk into a gas station, they'd have cardboard C-3PO's.It was all "Star Wars, Star Wars, and the new, the new Power of the Force line's coming out..the Extended Universe figures, and here's the Timothy Zahn novels, and we just killed Chewbacca!" Star Wars is, was everywhere. And instead of dying down after that, it came out with Episode I, which was followed by a new bonanza of Star Wars merchandise. You had, now you had the, uh, red Star Wars cardboard boxes all over the Toys-R-Us, and you had the Jar Jar Binks telephone, the, the Jar Jar Binks punching bag. I wish they had that, actually. The, the Darth Maul Wake-Em-Up Swing-a-Sword clock.

GARRETT:
Did you have Star Wars toys?

LISA:
I did, I did. And I still have, like, the AT-AT's that are worth, like, $200 now, and I'm not gonna sell 'em ever. And so, yeah, I still have all my toys.

GARRETT:
You play the Star Wars RPG?

DAVID:
Star Wars RPG, yes. Dorkily, I did. The role-playing game in the Star Wars universe. In fact, I still do.

GARRETT:
Wow, still?

DAVID:
A little.

GARRETT:
When was the last time you played?

DAVID:
Um, before I came out to LA for Gods of Los Angeles.

GARRETT:
That was just a couple of weeks ago.

DAVID:
Yep.

GARRETT:
Wow.

DAVID:
It's pretty dark, yeah, I know. But I like it. I like, uh, we're definitely not typical RPG'ers. I mean, we're not that...nah, we're dorks. We're RPG'ers. Do we wanna get into, uh, Phantom Menace now?

GARRETT:
Yes.

DAVID:
Um, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed by a film in my entire life.

GARRETT:
In your entire life?

DAVID:
I was temporarily crushed by watching The Phantom Menace. I, it really, um, shattered, uh, an icon of my childhood.

GARRETT:
What do you thiink of The Phantom Menace?

JESSE:
I liked it the first time I saw it. And I think I like it less and less every time I see it. But I watched it, like, uh, like two weeks ago. I dunno. It was still fun. I mean, it was, there was obviously a lot lacking from it, from the first, but I still enjoyed it. Because I, I, I'm a dork.

GARRETT:
Because you're a dork?

JESSE:
Because I'm a dork.

GARRETT:
You consider yourself a dork?

JESSE:
I'm a big dork. I like that shit. It's fun. It, I dunno, maybe it's, maybe it's just because it's something that me and my brother can actually bond on or something. You know, like, talk about. That's all we, that's all we have in common. Maybe, maybe that's it. I dunno, we can always talk about Star Wars, and...

GARRETT:
Would you say Star Wars touches everyone?

JESSE:
Most people differently, but 90% of the population it touches, though...

GARRETT:
Wrong?

JESSE:
...anger.

GARRETT:
It touches them wrong? The bad touch?

JESSE:
It's the kind of touch they can take to court.

GARRETT:
Cory, are you a Star Wars fan?

CORY:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Did you like The Phantom Menace?

CORY:
Nope.

GARRETT:
Because why not?

JAY:
Children.

CORY:
Uh, I'll have to agree with him on Jar Jar Binks. Also, more than half of the characters in it were computer-generated.

GARRETT:
Mm-hmm.

CORY:
And, so it had no feeling or emotion or any human, like, I dunno, there was nothing to connect to.

LISA:
The Phantom Menace, I saw, um, five times in the theater, and it reminded me of a Muppets movie because it was so, like, childlike, and I just didn't, I think I had too high of expectations going in because it was, like, George Lucas and a new Star Wars movie, and we hadn't had one in so long. And it reminded me of a Muppets movie with, like, the Jar Jar Binks, and I, I just didn't like it.

GARRETT:
But you saw it five times?

LISA:
I saw it five times because I wanted so badly to like it.

GARRETT:
Harry, are you a Star Wars fan?

HARRY:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Uh, what did you think of The Phantom Menace?

HARRY:
Um, I didn't like The Phantom Menace.

GARRETT:
Why not?

HARRY:
Because it really sucked. No, um, it was aimed at too young of a target audience. It was pretty hokey. I went to it hoping for something, you know, I could accept it if it was aimed for, like, a 14-year old. Because that's what the first three movies really were. But it was for, like, a 6-year old. It just sucked, yeah. And, I mean, everyone blames Jar Jar, but really what made the movie hurt was Anakin. Phantom Menace was a piece of crap.

LISA:
It's a Muppets movie. And I like the Muppets. But just not from George Lucas.

GARRETT:
Not from George Lu...well, was Return of the Jedi a Muppet movie?

LISA:
No! No, that was so different, because the Ewoks, they, they were, like, their own little creatures, their own little world, and they were, they were very, I think they were well done. But I just, I didn't like Phantom Menace, to be honest. No.

GARRETT:
But Jedi had a lot of Muppets in it. Technically, Phantom Menace has no actual Muppets.

LISA:
No, but, even, like, a computer-generized, I just don't, not a fan.

GARRETT:
Do you think Lucas is, uh, pandering to children?

LISA:
I don't even know what he is doing. I, I really don't. I still love him, and I still love the first three. I just don't like what he's doing now, necessarily.
