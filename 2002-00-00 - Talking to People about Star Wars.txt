GARRETT:
Tell me about Star Wars, Rich.

RICH:
Oh, where to begin?

JOHN:
Action?
You don't say action where you're asking people about Star Wars.

GARRETT:
Yes, you do.

JOHN:
Oh.

JAY:
I can't think of anything clever to say, because I'm tired.

JOHN:
And, at such a per-, oh, are you feeding me my lines now?

GARRETT:
Uh, this is an interview about Star Wars.
What is Star Wars?

JAY:
What is it?

GARRETT:
Yeah.

JAY:
You mean, to me, or just in general?

GARRETT:
Either.

JAY:
Um, it's a lot of, a lot of bullshit.

GARRETT:
Really?
Star Wars is a lot of bullshit?

JAY:
Ehh...

GARRETT:
Why?
Uh, are you a Star Wars fan?

JAY:
I, I was a Star Wars fan, and I just got really tired of it after a while.

RICH:
I don't really care anymore.

GARRETT:
Why not?

RICH:
Um, well, a combination of, uh, this prequel stuff just offending me on many levels.

GARRETT:
It offends you?

RICH:
It offends me by, by just being horrible, and being thrown in my face.
And I think Star Wars in general, Phantom Menace or no, is just grossly overexposed.

GARRETT:
Overrated, or just overexposed?

RICH:
Overexposed.
Overexposed.
Not overrated.
I thiink the original trilogy is brilliant.
Very brilliant.

LISA:
Yeah, it is.

GARRETT:
Yeah, exactly.

LISA:
Okay.

GARRETT:
Are you a Star Wars fan?

LISA:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Why are you a Star Wars fan?

LISA:
Why am I a Star Wars fan?
Um, um...there's gonna be a long pause here while I think.

GARRETT:
I think most people are questioning their Star Wars fandom at this point.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I used to be.
And I'm not sure anymore.
Kind of like a, an agnostic.
I question the existence of Star Wars.

GARRETT:
Are you a Star Wars fan?

JESSE:
Yes, yes I am.

GARRETT:
How long have you been a Star Wars fan?

JESSE:
Um, gosh, pretty long time.
As long as I can remember, I'd say.

GARRETT:
Are you looking forward to, uh, Attack of the Clones?

JESSE:
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Whether I'm embarrassed to say so, but...

GARRETT:
You, you're admitting.
That's great.

JESSE:
I'm admitting it.
I, I, I, I, you know, as much as I'd love to suppress, I go along with the mass populace.
I'm actually, uh, relatively, relatively excited about it, just because, just because, I know it's not gonna be good, but I'm still gonna, like, I'm still gonna have fun, it's still gonna be a joy, and it's, it's, you know...

GARRETT:
Because it's Star Wars?

JESSE:
Because it's, because there are light sabers in it and...that's all I care about anymore.
That's all the new trilogy has going for it.

RICH:
During the 80's, it was cool to like Star Wars.
You had a lot of 20-something-year olds running around, you know, discussing the, the merits of the Death Star and how great Han Solo was as a character.

GARRETT:
Would people get on you for this if they...

JESSE:
Oh, yeah, some of them, yes, I...I know Jay would be, like, shaking his head.
But whatever dude, it's gonna, it's, I'm still gonna have fun.
I know, it can be total shit, and I'd, I'd, I mean, I'm gonna buy it.
I'm gonna set it on my shelf.
I'm gonna watch it probably, like, once a month or something.

GARRETT:
Uh, you were a Star Wars fan as a kid.

DAVID:
Um, I don't, I, probably not possible that anyone could have been more a Star Wars than I was as a kid.
I mean, no, that's not true.
I mean, I wasn't incredibly hardcore, like, collecting all the toys, buying all sorts of merchandise.
But I did have toys.
I watched the movies regularly.
Um, when the video game, X-Wing, came out for PC, it was my life.
X-Wing vs TIE Fighter was revamped for X-Wing Alliance, the final say in X-Wing games, in which you could fly as all sorts of ships, fight in superior Starl Destroyers, it was incredible.
You could make your own missions.
I was in heaven there.

JOHN:
It doesn't, I don't know if it really irks me, but it just sort of confuses me that people are actually able to view this Star Wars movies as movies.
I mean, the Star Wars movies have such a, are sort of integral part of the culture, and such an integral part of, I mean, my childhood.

DAVID:
I really love the Star Wars story.
To me, it is the quintessential drama.

JOHN:
I can't distinctly remember the first time I saw Star Wars, and it was this great moment and, or anything like that.
I can't, I can't even distinctly remember a time when I watched Star Wars.
But I know that I watched it so many countless times that, I mean, I mean, everyone of, of my generation just sort of knows those movies back-to-front.
It's sort of, it's a given, you know?
Except for maybe girls.

GARRETT:
Girls?

JOHN:
Girls don't know Star Wars.

LISA:
I guess it's gonna be the same thing everybody says about, like, when I was little, I, like, fell in love with the characters and the story, and, like, there's just, like, such a cool world that, like, I wanted to be a part of.
And, like, the new movies, I'm not such a big fan of.

MIKE:
I question whether or not George Lucas is in charge of his own mind anymore.
Whether or not the Star Wars, uh, operation is merely a big hack-job used to sell merchandise, or if it's an actual vision that he wants to commit to film, or he just wants to sell plastic Jar Jar Binks dolls.

GARRETT:
Which side are you leaning on?

MIKE:
The plastic Jar Jar Binks dolls side.

RICH:
You have the, the Special Editions.
I didn't mind these.
I know they've fucked with them, but it's just nice seeing them on the big screen.
But, with that, you had the, this marketing blitz that was just insane.
You'd walk into a toy store and you'd, uh, see nothing but seas of that, that, uh, orange and green cardboard boxes they had.
You'd walk into a gas station, they'd have cardboard C-3PO's.
It was all "Star Wars, Star Wars, and the new, the new Power of the Force line's coming out...the Extended Universe figures, and here's the Timothy Zahn novels, and we just killed Chewbacca!"
Star Wars is, was everywhere.
And instead of dying down after that, it came out with Episode I, which was followed by a new bonanza of Star Wars merchandise.
You had, now you had the, uh, red Star Wars cardboard boxes all over the Toys-R-Us, and you had the Jar Jar Binks telephone, the, the Jar Jar Binks punching bag.
I wish they had that, actually.
The, the Darth Maul Wake-Em-Up Swing-a-Sword clock.

GARRETT:
Did you have Star Wars toys?

LISA:
I did, I did.
And I still have, like, the AT-AT's that are worth, like, $200 now, and I'm not gonna sell 'em ever.
And so, yeah, I still have all my toys.

GARRETT:
You play the Star Wars RPG?

DAVID:
Star Wars RPG, yes.
Dorkily, I did.
The role-playing game in the Star Wars universe.
In fact, I still do.

GARRETT:
Wow, still?

DAVID:
A little.

GARRETT:
When was the last time you played?

DAVID:
Um, before I came out to LA for Gods of Los Angeles.

GARRETT:
That was just a couple of weeks ago.

DAVID:
Yep.

GARRETT:
Wow.

DAVID:
It's pretty dark, yeah, I know.
But I like it.
I like, uh, we're definitely not typical RPG'ers.
I mean, we're not that...nah, we're dorks.
We're RPG'ers.
Do we wanna get into, uh, Phantom Menace now?

GARRETT:
Yes.

DAVID:
Um, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed by a film in my entire life.

GARRETT:
In your entire life?

DAVID:
I was temporarily crushed by watching The Phantom Menace.
I, it really, um, shattered, uh, an icon of my childhood.

GARRETT:
What do you thiink of The Phantom Menace?

JESSE:
I liked it the first time I saw it.
And I think I like it less and less every time I see it.
But I watched it, like, uh, like two weeks ago.
I dunno.
It was still fun.
I mean, it was, there was obviously a lot lacking from it, from the first, but I still enjoyed it.
Because I, I, I'm a dork.

GARRETT:
Because you're a dork?

JESSE:
Because I'm a dork.

GARRETT:
You consider yourself a dork?

JESSE:
I'm a big dork.
I like that shit.
It's fun.
It, I dunno, maybe it's, maybe it's just because it's something that me and my brother can actually bond on or something.
You know, like, talk about.
That's all we, that's all we have in common.
Maybe, maybe that's it.
I dunno, we can always talk about Star Wars, and...

GARRETT:
Would you say Star Wars touches everyone?

JESSE:
Most people differently, but 90% of the population it touches, though...

GARRETT:
Wrong?

JESSE:
...anger.

GARRETT:
It touches them wrong?
The bad touch?

JESSE:
It's the kind of touch they can take to court.

GARRETT:
Cori, are you a Star Wars fan?

CORI:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Did you like The Phantom Menace?

CORI:
Nope.

GARRETT:
Because why not?

JAY:
Children.

CORI:
Uh, I'll have to agree with him on Jar Jar Binks.
Also, more than half of the characters in it were computer-generated.

GARRETT:
Mm-hmm.

CORI:
And, so it had no feeling or emotion or any human, like, I dunno, there was nothing to connect to.

LISA:
The Phantom Menace, I saw, um, five times in the theater, and it reminded me of a Muppets movie because it was so, like, childlike, and I just didn't, I think I had too high of expectations going in because it was, like, George Lucas and a new Star Wars movie, and we hadn't had one in so long.
And it reminded me of a Muppets movie with, like, the Jar Jar Binks, and I, I just didn't like it.

GARRETT:
But you saw it five times?

LISA:
I saw it five times because I wanted so badly to like it.

GARRETT:
Harry, are you a Star Wars fan?

HARRY:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Uh, what did you think of The Phantom Menace?

HARRY:
Um, I didn't like The Phantom Menace.

GARRETT:
Why not?

HARRY:
Because it really sucked.
No, um, it was aimed at too young of a target audience.
It was pretty hokey.
I went to it hoping for something, you know, I could accept it if it was aimed for, like, a 14-year old.
Because that's what the first three movies really were.
But it was for, like, a 6-year old.
It just sucked, yeah.
And, I mean, everyone blames Jar Jar, but really what made the movie hurt was Anakin.
Phantom Menace was a piece of crap.

LISA:
It's a Muppets movie.
And I like the Muppets.
But just not from George Lucas.

GARRETT:
Not from George Lu...well, was Return of the Jedi a Muppet movie?

LISA:
No!
No, that was so different, because the Ewoks, they, they were, like, their own little creatures, their own little world, and they were, they were very, I think they were well done.
But I just, I didn't like Phantom Menace, to be honest.
No.

GARRETT:
But Jedi had a lot of Muppets in it.
Technically, Phantom Menace has no actual Muppets.

LISA:
No, but, even, like, a computer-generized, I just don't, not a fan.

GARRETT:
Do you think Lucas is, uh, pandering to children?

LISA:
I don't even know what he is doing.
I, I really don't.
I still love him, and I still love the first three.
I just don't like what he's doing now, necessarily.

DAVID;
Um, I wrote a bit where George was sno...snorting cocaine.
Uh, you might take that as comedy, but I actually wrote that with the deepest hatred in mind.
I was actually very unheatlhy, how much hate I felt after that.
And I continued to hate, uh, for a while, up until Attack of the Clones, when I said, you know, I still hated George Lucas, had an incredibly low opinion of him, but I said, "What the hell, I'll go see the second one."
"You know, I'm kind of giving in here, but I'll go see it."

HARRY:
NSYNC is Jedi?

MIKE:
Lucasfilm is kind of like the dark side...

GARRETT:
Mm.

MIKE:
As far as crushing, crushing people that, you know, infringe on the Star Wars copyrights, and things like that.
The whole evil marketing angle to it, and the fact that the movie isn't mere filmed commercials.

GARRETT:
Do you think that Lucasfilm is the evil empire?

MIKE:
I wouldn't go so far.
Actually, that was...Russia?

RICH:
This newer trilogy is going to suck, and it's going to fade away.
George Lucas is going to die.
Sooner or later, nobody will care.

JAY:
The Phantom Menace kind of...I enjoyed it for a little while.
And then I started to think about it, and I was like, "Wow, that really sucked."
And then I watched the old movies, and I just didn't enjoy them anymore.

GARRETT:
So you're not looking forward to Attack of the Clones?

JAY:
No.
Not at all.
I don't plan on seeing it if I have to pay.
I'll, I'll sneak in, or I'll have someone get me in for free.

GARRETT:
Are you looking forward to Attack of the Clones?

CORI:
No.
Um, it looks like it'll be slightly more interesting than Phantom Menace, hopefully, but...then again, we also had a lot of hopes for Phantom Menace, and it didn't turn out very well, so...

HARRY:
I was hyped up to be disappoiinted when I went to see the first one.
This time, I'm just not even going.

GARRETT:
You're not even going?

HARRY:
If people come back and tell me to go ahead and go, then I'll go.
But I'm assuming it will hurt me so bad that I'm not going.

GARRETT:
Are you looking forward to Attack of the Clones?

MIKE:
Um, like I told Rich with Episode I, I was looking forward to the Star Wars saga, the plot, the characters, the story.
With Episode II, I've kind of, um, put all those things expectations aside, and I really just wanna see interesting Star Wars fight scenes and explosions, and just basically a special effect movie.
That's really what I wanna see, even though it's argued that that's what the first three are, but I really think there is a little more to those than that.
But the first one just sort of shattered all expectations of the ori-, the first three films in the saga having any kind of interesting story.
I mean, it's just kind of ruined from now on, with the fact that Obi-Wan's character and Anakin's character have all just been ruined, basically, so...there's really nothing you can do at this point to save it, other than completely erase time and remake the movie.

GARRETT:
Would you still consider yourself a Star Wars fan?

RICH:
I, no, I don't, but not in the I'm-angry-and-I'm-rebelling sense.
It's in the I-just-don't-care-anymore sense.
I'm, I'm jazzed about the Spider-Man movie.
The clone movie, I, I don't care about.
When I heard about the title Attack of the Clones...well, okay, here, let's put it this way.
When I heard Episode I was going to be called The Phantom Menace, I was first, uh, I didn't believe it.
I thought it was a Mike Stoklasa joke.
Really.And I think I was walking around for a week believing it was a Mike Stoklasa joke.
Uh, and then I was, like, angry and incensed.
And the movie came out, and the movie was horrible, but...then I heard about Attack of the Clones title, and my initial reaction was just to laugh, thinking, "Oh, he's just gonna fuck this one up, too."
I'm, I'm, I'm, um, I'm looking at this Episode II, of the way my, my general mindset, and when I'm looking at this, it's, it's like I'm looking at a trainwreck.
I'm fascinated by how horrible it's gonna be, and all the things are gonna, all of the people are gonna go, "It's a wonderful movie, it's still a great trilogy!"
And I'm just gonna, like, look at it and just...ugh, god.

DAVID:
I like Episode II.
However, you will never get me to admit that Episode II is a good movie, because it is not.
It is a crappy movie.
It is better than Episode I, but that is saying very little.
Episode II endears itself to me because it continues the Star Wars story.
This one, the plot really suddenly has something to do with the original trilogy, whereas Episode I was kind of, like, just meandering around, making, like, they had two movies, but they had to start at somewhere, so they just kind of made a story.
Episode I was just utter shit.
Except for the light saber fight at the end.
That one's pretty cool.
But, uh, Episode II, actually, the light saber fights in Episode II weren't quite as good as the one at the end of Episode I, but...and the story and script for Episode II were pretty damn weak, uh, specifically.
Overall, I really liked the story, but in its actual execution, it was pretty fucking terrible.
Um, a lot of bad acting, but I like Hayden Christiansen.
I like the way he played the role, even if it was written real, way too whiny.
He played it as well as you could have.
It was a horribly-written role, and he played it really, rather well.
People blame him for the fact that he's whiny, but that's the writing, not his, I mean, he made it as serious and relevant as he could have.
I don't know how I feel about the Jedi after Episode II.
They seem a little too eager to kill people in Episode II.
They really seem, start to come out as the warriors in Episode II, and that, that was something I wasn't ready for.
Like, seeing Yoda lead armies, Mace Windu decapitate someone so quickly and with a, and there's a part where Ewan McGregor stabs that spider thingy, and he makes a "Urghh!" face.
Uh, the whole Jedi ethos really seemed a little off in Episode II, but I, I admit I thought about it a lot because it bothered me, and I think I've come to terms with it a little bit.
Episode II is a bad movie, but I like it.
I somehow find a way to like it, and I have really high hopes for Episode III.

RICH:
I'm so sick of it right now.
And I imagine the whole will be.
I, I think by the time the, the prequels are over, Star Wars is going to fade into oblivion.
Instead of having the aura of those three awesome movie, it's gonna have the aura of those three sci-fi special effects bonanzas without a heart.
People might actually overlook the originals.
It's gonna die out soon.
It's not gonna last forever.
It's not that good.
Nothing's that good.
Sex is that good.
Sex is gonna last forever.

GARRETT:
What, what would you watch instead of Star Wars?

JAY:
What would I watch that's coming out?

GARRETT:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Soon?
What is coming on?
More bullshit, really.
Uh...there's lots of bullshit.
Indie, Hollywood, whatever.

RICH:
All said and done, Star Wars is just another product.
Come-and-go, just like any other product.

GARRETT:
Is, is it just like any other product?

RICH:
I think for a while, before he had the marketing blitz, it, it was something else.
To the people who grew up with it, the, the, the ten-year olds who saw Return of the Jedi in a theater, it was something very special.
But I think that's been marred now.

GARRETT:
You don't think there was always a merchandizing blitz for Star Wars?

RICH:
It was always, but when you're ten, you don't notice it.

GARRETT:
What about the older generation?

RICH:
The older older generation?
Probably didn't care in the first place.
It's, like, how many people talk about, uh, should be some 80's...

GARRETT:
Starship Troopers.

RICH:
Starship Troopers.
Nobody talks about Starship Troopers.

GARRETT:
Total Recall.

JAY:
I talk about Starship Troopers.

RICH:
Total Recall, you remember bits.

GARRETT:
Robocop.

RICH:
You remember these movies, but they weren't like Star Wars was to us.
They were just movies.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Just movies.

GARRETT:
Terminator II?

RICH:
Not as big as Star Wars.
It's a good movie, but it's not, it's not a, uh, mind-altering, life-changing experience.

GARRETT:
Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail...

RICH:
Well, you know, some of us will just adore forever.

DAVID:
It's a shame that Star Wars now has to complete with Lord of the Rings.
I love Star Wars.
I still love Star Wars.
I've watched the movies recently, and, except for Return of the Jedi, which is half-shit, half-brilliance, I love them all.

GARRETT:
The first half is shit?

DAVID:
That first half is pretty fucking bad.
But the, the whole throne room scene, Battle of Endor...perfect.

JESSE:
I, I think it'd be really cool if George Lucas, uh, sold the Star Wars license to someone who was capable.
Like, I dunno, Peter Jackson would've been cool.
Just, somebody, somebody else.
You know, just, just to see what they would do with it because it, it'd have to better than the new trilogy.
C'mon.

GARRETT:
It'd have to be better.

JESSE:
It'd have to be.
There's no way it couldn't be, unless you, like...

GARRETT:
Give it to Ron Howard.

JESSE:
Yeah.
Yeah, he would fuck it up.

DAVID:
I've never said this before in my life, but I'm gonna reveal it now.
And the thing I wanna do with my life is, I wanna make a Star Wars movie.

GARRETT:
A Star Wars, an actual, in the Star Wars trilogy?

DAVID:
A Star Wars that George Lucas let's me make.
I might have to wait until after he's dead.
I might have to make a whole career of movie-making first just to make this possible, but I want to write and direct a Star Wars movie.
I want to do what Steven Spielberg could not.

GARRETT:
Holy shit.

DAVID:
Uh, it's probably impossible.
I'm probably a fool for even saying it, but that's what I really wanna do.

GARRETT:
Would you make it if it wasn't Star Wars?
Would you do something else?
Like, George Lucas couldn't get the rights to Buck Rogers, so he made Star Wars.

DAVID:
I thought about that, but it would just feel like a Star Wars rip-off.
I want us, I wanna tell a great story in the Star Wars setting.
That's the thing I love about Star Wars is, the original trilogy was a great story, but also offers a great setting.
A galactic civilization.
There's so much you could deal with.
There's so many sociological, philosophical things that are totally untouched upon there.
I mean, Star Wars really isn't about deep philosophical things, but I think it can be at the same time about visceral good-vs-evil type of things.
When I first decided, "Hey, it'd be cool if I could make movies," you know, I never admitted to myself, but I wanna make a Star Wars movie.
Just Star Wars movies?
No.
I wanna do all sorts of stuff that has nothing to do with Star Wars, but I wanna come back some day.
I wanna make a, I want it to be authorized by George Lucas, you know?
If I have to, like, bribe someone in his estate after he's dead or, like, spend time at his bedside while he's dying, whatever.
Somehow, John Williams will still be alive so he can do the score.
Oh, it'd be a shame if John Williams died, because he can repeat himself a lot, but that man is, writes some great fucking music.

GARRETT:
You think if you hadn't seen the first three, you would've liked Phantom Menace?

LISA:
No.
And I definitely wouldn't have seen it five times.
So, no.

GARRETT:
If you could say anything to George Lucas now, what would it be?

LISA:
What would it be?
I would say that, um, I love his early work and the first three Star Wars, and I'm a huge fan, and I'm not, um, as big a fan as what he's doing now -- I mean, I respect that -- and that the first three aren't gonna, like, change my view of him.
I'm still, like, I think they're great, so, I still, I still love him.
He's great.

GARRETT:
Are you looking forward to Attack of the Clones?

LISA:
Um, I saw the trailer, and one thing, I just, it didn't really do a lot for me.

GARRETT:
Are you gonna see it?

LISA:
Yes.
Probably not five times, but I'll see it.

GARRETT:
Are you gonna be there opening, uh, weekend?

LISA:
Yeah.
I'm not gonna dress up or anything, but I'll be there right when it comes out.

GARRETT:
You're not gonna be an Ewok?

LISA:
No, defnitely not.

GARRETT:
You're not gonna be Jar Jar?

LISA:
My fanhood doesn't cross, like, where I dress up and paint myself, and do my, like, Leia wig.
No, I don't do that.
I just like to watch...

GARRETT:
You have a Leia wig?

LISA:
No, no, no, no.

GARRETT:
Okay.

JOHN:
People seem sort of guilty about liking Star Wars because a lot of people have taken it too far.
It's, I mean, it's the same thing with any sort of sci-fi franchise.
Things like Star Trek or, um, like, Star Trek or Star Wars, basically.
What else do people get obsessed about?
Um...

GARRETT:
Um, The Golden Girls.

JOHN:
The Golden Girls.
Yeah, when they dress up like The Golden Girls.

DAVID:
Episode II definitely fueled in me a desire to Star Wars role-play again.
That's why we're doing it.

JOHN:
A lot of people are really gung ho, and they buy all the toys, and they have all the posters, and, you know, the drinking cups and whole nine yards, and they're really about the Star Wars.
And a lot of people are really about it, but they keep quiet because I think it's sort of looked upon as sort of a bad thing to be really about Star Wars, because it's very sort of geeky.

DAVID:
I love Star Wars.
I think a lot of people make it really stupid.
Like, I'm definitely a Star Wars geek, but I definitely distance myself from a lot of stuff that goes on in there.
I'd like to think I have a more mature approach to the whole Star Wars experience.
Ugh, experience.

LISA:
I dunno.
I think they're, like, the greatest movies of all time, the first three.
And, I dunno, they've just, like, I've always loved them, and they're always going to be my favorite movie.
I just think it's, like, George Lucas did an amzing job on the first three, and the story and the characters, everything is put together so well, and so amazing, it's just, like, such an incredible world that, even if I don't like the new ones coming out, I mean, I still, everybody still has those first three, so...I think it's great.

RICH:
George Lucas is a big fat asshole.
George Lucas is a bearded mongrel.
George Lucas is a doo-doo head.
