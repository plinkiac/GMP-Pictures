GARRETT:
Tell me about Star Wars, Rich.

RICH:
Oh, where to begin?

["A long, long time ago"]

JOHN:
Action? You don't say action where you're asking people about Star Wars.

GARRETT:
Yes, you do.

JOHN:
Oh.

["Naboo was under an attack"]

["And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn"]

JAY:
I can't think of anything clever to say,because I'm tired.

["...into maybe cutting them a little slack"]

JOHN:
And, at such a per-, oh, are you feeding me my lines now?

["But their response, it didn't thrill us"]

["They locked the doors and tried to kill us"]

["We escaped from that gas"]

["Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass"]

["We took a bongo from the scene"]

GARRETT:
Uh, this is an interview about Star Wars. What is Star Wars?

JAY:
What is it?

GARRETT:
Yeah.

JAY:
You mean, to me, or just in general?

GARRETT:
Either.

JAY:
Um, it's a lot of, a lot of bullshit.

GARRETT:
Really? Star Wars is a lot of bullshit?

JAY:
Ehh...

GARRETT:
Why? Uh, are you a Star Wars fan?

JAY:
I, I was a Star Wars fan, and I just got really tired of it after a while.

RICH:
I don't really care anymore.

GARRETT:
Why not?

RICH:
Um, well, a combination of, uh, this prequel stuff just offending me on many levels.

GARRETT:
It offends you?

RICH:
It offends me by, by just being horrible, and being thrown in my face. And I think Star Wars in general, Phantom Menace or no, is just grossly overexposed.

GARRETT:
Overrated, or just overexposed?

RICH:
Overexposed. Overexposed. Not overrated. I thiink the original trilogy is brilliant. Very brilliant.

LISA:
Yeah, it is.

GARRETT:
Yeah, exactly.

LISA:
Okay.

GARRETT:
Are you a Star Wars fan?

LISA:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Why are you a Star Wars fan?

LISA:
Why am I a Star Wars fan? Um, um...there's gonna be a long pause here while I think.

GARRETT:
I think most people are questioning their Star Wars fandom at this point.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I used to be. And I'm not sure anymore. Kind of like a, an agnostic. I question the existence of Star Wars.

GARRETT:
Are you a Star Wars fan?

JESSE:
Yes, yes I am. 

GARRETT:
How long have you been a Star Wars fan?

JESSE:
Um, gosh, pretty long time. As long as I can remember, I'd say.

GARRETT:
Are you looking forward to, uh, Attack of the Clones?

JESSE:
Yeah. Yes, I am. Whether I'm embarrassed to say so, but...

GARRETT:
You, you're admitting. That's great.

JESSE:
I'm admitting it. I, I, I, I, you know, as much as I'd love to suppress, I go along with the mass populace. I'm actually, uh, relatively, relatively excited about it, just because, just because, I know it's not gonna be good, but I'm still gonna, like, I'm still gonna have fun, it's still gonna be a joy, and it's, it's, you know...

GARRETT:
Because it's Star Wars?

JESSE:
Because it's, because there are light sabers in it and...that's all I care about anymore. That's all the new trilogy has going for it.

RICH:
During the 80's, it was cool to like Star Wars. You had a lot of 20-something-year olds running around, you know, discussing the, the merits of the Death Star and how great Han Solo was as a character.

GARRETT:
Would people get on you for this if they...

JESSE:
Oh, yeah, some of them, yes, I...I know Jay would be, like, shaking his head. But whatever dude, it's gonna, it's, I'm still gonna have fun. I know, it can be total shit, and I'd, I'd, I mean, I'm gonna buy it. I'm gonna set it on my shelf. I'm gonna watch it probably, like, once a month or something.

GARRETT:
Uh, you were a Star Wars fan as a kid.

DAVID:
Um, I don't, I, probably not possible that anyone could have been more a Star Wars than I was as a kid. I mean, no, that's not true. I mean, I wasn't incredibly hardcore, like, collecting all the toys, buying all sorts of merchandise. But I did have toys. I watched the movies regularly. Um, when the video game, X-Wing, came out for PC, it was my life. X-Wing vs TIE Fighter was revamped for X-Wing Alliance, the final say in X-Wing games, in which you could fly as all sorts of ships, fight in superior Starl Destroyers, it was incredible. You could make your own missions. I was in heaven there.

JOHN:
It doesn't, I don't know if it really irks me, but it just sort of confuses me that people are actually able to view this Star Wars movies as movies. I mean, the Star Wars movies have such a, are sort of integral part of the culture, and such an integral part of, I mean, my childhood.

DAVID:
I really love the Star Wars story. To me, it is the quinessential drama.

JOHN:
I can't distinctly remember the first time I saw Star Wars, and it was this great moment and, or anything like that. I can't, I can't even distinctly remember a time when I watched Star Wars. But I know that I watched it so many countless times that, I mean, I mean, everyone of, of my generation just sort of knows those movies back-to-front. It's sort of, it's a given, you know? Except for maybe girls.

GARRETT:
Girls?

JOHN:
Girls don't know Star Wars.

LISA:
I guess it's gonna be the same thing everybody says
