Hello, what?
Hey, Sid.
Here, get back in your chair.
Hey, Sid.
Look, I know you're not the cleanest guy in the world, but were you urinating in the sink again?
What?
Fuck you!
What have I told you about that?
Yes.
Then how do you explain the urine in the sink?
I rented Deathlist.
I feel dirty because I've been watching Deathlist.
What the hell is Deathlist?
Fuck you!
No, that's not what, my last roommate, he, he wasn't really the greatest actor in the world, but at least he was clean.
Get out!
Fuck you, get out!
Get out!
Look, I gotta go to work.
Get out.
Get out!
Alright, I'm going to work.
I'll be back in a few hours.
Rodney, don't call here for a while.
I've got to do me dishes.
Dishes, dishes...filth...how does one do dishes?
He wants to clean the dishes.
I'll clean them right good.
Perhaps a little dubles.
Right good!
A magic soap.
Oh, the magic does.
How does one, oh!
Heavens have mercy, the most awful stench.
Oh!
And this is the basement.
Now, I'm gonna go back upstairs and work for a bit.
Uh, why don't you just kinda, you know, get to know the basement, familiarize yourself.
And I'll come back down and check on you in a few minutes.
Don't get in any trouble.
Oh, heavens.
Good, good grief.
Heavens have mercy, what is that smell?
Heavens!
To get 'em, I'm going to get all the chickens.
Remember that.
Remember that.
Remember I got to get out of chains.
Deathlist?
Deathlist?
Where is Deathlist?
Might be in Blockbuster.
Get it there, and rent.

Okay.
Thank you.
Who's named 'Sid'?
You know him, he came in once, I really don't know.
He looks a little bit like you, actually.
Really?
I'm writing down the address now.
Actually, don't.
I hope you get sucked up by a vacuum cleaner.
When Arlo Jenkins comes through that door, I'm gonna put a bullet between his tits.
Cuz I'm gonna shoot him in his good eye.
Arlo Jenkins!
And then one between his eyes.
Deathlist.
All roads lead back to Deathlist.
Now, Monkey Man, you had a little trouble in the basement.
We're gonna try you out on the cash register, see if things go better, okay?
Tape measure, tape measure, yeah, so this is the cash register.
Um, we'll give you a password a little later.
Don't hit buttons on the register, please.
Actually, uh, there's a little perk to this job they don't tell you about when they hire you--no, don't do that.
Here's what I mean.
Ring, ring this woman up.
Hiya, can, can I write a check?
Yeah, sure.
No problem.
Are you looking down my shirt?
Uh, no.
Is this monkey the manager?
I, how do you let your Employees do this kind of thing?
This is disgraceful, I can't believe that, I came here to buy one little thing, and I get--
Augh, not my eye!
My eye!
Thank you, Monkey Man, for saving me from that pervert.
Can I, uh, come back to your house?
Okay, uh, Arlo Jenkins.
Sounds like a date.
