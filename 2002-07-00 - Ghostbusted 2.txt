DAVID ASHE:
If someone had corn on the cob for breakfast, and then took a shit, the little chunks of the corn would still be in their shit, right?
You'd have the log.
Inside the log would be kernels of corn.
Undigested.
That was their breakfast.
Now let's suppose you go over to this piece of shit and pick out the kernels of corn and eat them yourself.
Did you eat their breakfast?
What the fuck is that?
What's the fucking answer for that?
How the fuck are you supposed to live when you can eat someone else's breakfast?
I'm tired.

JAY:
You do realize this is gonna be the worst thing ever made here, right?

MARC LINN:
Is it a Ghostbusted 2?
Yeah?

GARRETT:
Action.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
The ending credits come up, and the first thing that starts off is it's a picture of me.
And I go, and I go, and I go, and I go,
"Look out!"
"Ghost!"
Like that, right?
And then, and then, like -- BOOM! -- the main title comes up on the screen.
The movie starts with me explaining how to start the movie.
And then you cut the thing that I explained about.

DAVID ASHE:
So, like, what we're talking about right now is gonna be the movie?

JOHN BRUGMANN:
This...

DAVID ASHE:
Our conversation is the fucking movie!
That's fucking brilliant!
I'm taking off my pants.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my fucking god.

JAY:
You know, Lisa?
It's really great being here in South Dakota	and everything for this festival.
But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I really really wanna kill a man.
I've never done it before.
I mean, surprising, I've never done it before.

LISA:
You wanna kill someone?

JAY:
Yeah, I mean...

LISA:
A man...
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah, a man.
Not a woman.

LISA:
Jay, where is this coming from?
Nowhere?
I mean, I have stange fantasies and illusions, too.
But I don't tell everyone I wanna hug an elephant.
And I do, but...

JAY:
You wanna hug an elephant?

LISA:
Let's get back to you wanna kill a man, Jay?

JAY:
I mean, I'd like to kill a man.
It's just...

LISA:
Really?

JAY:
Oh.
Hi.

MIKE:
Hi.

JAY:
What's going on?

MIKE:
Oh.
I changed my name to Albert.

JAY:
Albert?
What made you decide to do that?
But it was still...

MIKE:
I changed my last name, Albert, to Finney.

LISA:
Albert Finney?

MIKE:
I was in the bathroom, and I saw a ghost.

JAY:
Seriously?

LISA:
Oh, this is, this is great.
This is great.

MIKE:
I've been going around telling everybody not to use that particular restroom.

LISA:
Yep.

JAY:
I mean...

MIKE:
Well, I haven't been in the other restrooms.

LISA:
Would it, would it...
Was it a he?
Was it a she?
What did it look like?

JAY:
Did you get...
Yeah, what did it look like?

MIKE:
Well...
It was kind of androgynous.
It was like, uh, you know, with the, with the...

JAY:
Like Dennis Rodman?
Like, you don't know what's going on up there.

MIKE:
No, but it didn't look like Dennis Rodman.
It looked like a quivering, uh, mass of tentacles and glowing energy...

JAY:
You know, Mike?
I'm gonna be honest with you here.
I mean, it's, it's great to see you and everything.
Or, Albert.
I'm sorry.

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
But we, we kind of were having an important conversation before you came in.

MIKE:
Oh!

JAY:
Kind of interrupting something here.

MIKE:
Um, well...

LISA:
No, he's not.

JAY:
No, he is.

LISA:
Why don't you tell him what you wanna do, Jay?

JAY:
Oh, okay.
Well, here's the thing.
I, I really really want to kill a man.
Can you understand that?

MIKE:
A man, or...

LISA:
Listen to this.

JAY:
A man.

MIKE:
Well, who?

JAY:
I don't really know yet.

LISA:
Does that really matter?
He wants to kill a man.

MIKE:
Well, it does matter.

LISA:
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
If it's some guy from China, I don't care.

LISA:
Okay.

MIKE:
If it's someone from China...

JAY:
Wait, wait.
China.
You, what do you got against the Chinese?

MIKE:
Nothing.
There's just a lot of 'em.
If it's some guy...

JAY:
Well, I don't...

LISA:
What if it's you, Albert?
Is it okay then?
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, then I'd, I'd be, I'd be very interested knowing.
 
JAY:
Yeah.
It's a good thing it's not you that I wanna kill.

MIKE:
Oh.
Listen, I just came to warn you guys.

JAY:
Well, I really appreciate that.

LISA:
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

JAY:
And it's, you know, I really appreciate that you come to us first.

MIKE:
Let me tell you.
You know when you go down...

LISA:
Warn us from the tentacle...
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.

JAY:
So it's a really good thing that I don't wanna murder you.

LISA:
Thanks, Mike.
Albert.

JAY:
Because if I wanted to murder you, then, then I feel bad that you just came in and, and told us this information and warned us when the fact is, all I wanna do is kill you.
That'd be, I, I'd be coming off like an asshole, you know?
So that's...
It's a good thing that's not the case.
Are you all right?
What was that?

LISA:
Is that...
Are you okay?

MIKE:
What was what?

JAY:
What you just did.
What was that?
You, you did a little jerk movement, like...

LISA:
You did a little, like, spastic...

JAY:
It looked like someone, you know, hooked a car battery up to your testicles.

MIKE:
Holy shit.

JAY:
What?
I don't see anything.
Wait.
Are you all right?

LISA:
He's doing it!
What are you doing?

MIKE:
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

LISA:
Right.

JAY:
Well, then maybe you should just leave.

LISA:
Isn't it ironic...

MIKE:
Jesus, fuck me!

JAY:
Did you hear that?

LISA:
Yes!

JAY:
Why did you just say that to us?

LISA:
What the hell was that?

JAY:
Why did you say that to us?

MIKE:
What are you talking about?
Listen, I've been getting creeped out...

JAY:
That was vulgar.

MIKE:
I really think this film festival is haunted.

LISA:
What the hell is wrong with you?

JAY:
Well...

MIKE:
Listen, you guys are creeping me out.
The door is opening by itself, and...

JAY:
Oh, my gosh.

DAVID ASHE:
Ajar, here!
Stop.
I have to...
You can't touch my lightsaber.
It cuts you.

MIKE:
Cut.
Cut!

JAY:
So did Mike seema  little weird to you?

LISA:
Yeah.
I don't...
He's been like that lately.

JAY:
I mean...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

DAVID ASHE:
Hey!

LISA:
Hey, what's up?

DAVID ASHE:
How's it going?

LISA:
Good.

JAY:
Oh, I recognize you.
You were in that, that one movie, right?

DAVID ASHE:
So what's up?

LISA:
Nothing.

JAY:
Hey.
I recognize...

DAVID ASHE:
Do you like the pillows?

LISA:
I do, actually.
Thanks.

JAY:
No, you were in that one movie with the, the...
You had the beard on.

LISA:
You had a beard in a movie?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
No, no.
Those are my pillows.
Can I have my pillows back?
They're soft, and I like to switch them...

DAVID ASHE:
She like pillows.

LISA:
Thank you.

JAY:
Wait.
Why are...

DAVID ASHE:
What's your name?

LISA:
Uh, you don't...
Lisa.

DAVID ASHE:
Wonderful meeting you.

LISA:
Thanks.

DAVID ASHE:
Do you like Jedi?

LISA:
Jedi?

DAVID ASHE:
I love Jedi.
This is my lightsaber.

LISA:
Is it really?

JAY:
That's a piece of plastic.
That's so stupid.

DAVID ASHE:
It's only too stupid.
So shut the fuck up.

JAY:
No, that's not a real lightsaber.
She's not gonna fall for that, okay?
That's so dumb.

LISA:
Actually, can I see it?
Can I see it?

DAVID ASHE:
You wanna see how it works?

LISA:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
See, she wants to...

LISA:
Can I see it?

DAVID ASHE:
Isn't that awesome?

LISA:
That...

DAVID ASHE:
You wanna hold it?

LISA:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
I bet you're really good with it.

LISA:
I bet I am.

DAVID ASHE:
You need another pillow, I think.

JAY:
If you took that pillow off...
That's my pillow!
That's my fucking pillow!
You don't look very comfortable.
You got pillows all over you.
You look stupid.
He's making you look stupid.
Why are you putting up with this?

LISA:
Jay.

DAVID ASHE:
Isn't he being a little...

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's making you look stupid.

LISA:
He's like this often, too.

JAY:
I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of you here.
I don't, I don't want him to make you look stupid.

LISA:
You're telling me I look stupid, though.

JAY:
He's making you look stupid, though.
If it wasn't for him, you'd look just fine.

LISA:
Fine.
Just stop it, Jay.
I can't...

JAY:
Aughhh!
You're hitting me with your shoe.
Ow!
My shoulder!

DAVID ASHE:
Spain and coat as a puckle.

JAY:
Oh!
Fuck!
Water puddle!

DAVID ASHE:
Ah!
God!

JAY:
You could've crushed my hat!

DAVID ASHE:
I lost control.
The Jedi shall not know anger.
The Jedi shall not know anger.

JAY:
Murder him!

MAN IN FLORAL SHIRT:
It's okay!

DAVID ASHE:
Aughhh!

MAN IN FLORAL SHIRT:
It's okay!

DAVID ASHE:
Aughhh!

MAN IN FLORAL SHIRT:
It's okay!
It's okay!

JAY:
Oh, oh.
Do you hear that?
It's okay.
Let's go back out to the festival.
It'll be fun.

LISA:
God.

JAY:
We're gonna take his lightsaber, though.

LISA:
I bet you Deathlist is playing by now.

JAY:
Oh!
Oh, we don't wanna miss that.

LISA:
Goddammit.
We missed it.

DAVID ASHE:
What the fuck?
My asshole.
It looks like someone got shit all over your coat.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
That's disgusting.

DAVID ASHE:
Yeah.
What the hell is this crap?
Blood?
Someone have their period all over this?
Ugh!
Man, this is ever worse than that time I refrained from masturbating for three months.
I betcha it went 20 feet.
I'd kill someone if I shot that off inside of him.
God, I rock.
Someone's gonna be fucking pissed off.
Well, fuck you, man.
Fuck you, man.
No!
No!
Aughhh!
Aughhh!
Aughhh!
I'm gonna go take a shower now.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Clean up your freaking shampoo that exploded.
Look at this.
Somebody could slip in this and die.

DAVID ASHE:
Consume!
Consume!
Consume!
Consume!
Motherfucker!
Fucker!
Oh, fuck this!
Huh?
What?
What just happened?
It was like staring into the mouth of hell itself.
Let's go play Mario Bros 2!

DAVID ASHE:
Hi.
Uh, please state your name.

RICH:
Richard William Thomas, uh, Michael.

DAVID ASHE:
And you are trying out for the part of Rich Evans?

RICH:
Richard William Thomas Evans.
Correct.

DAVID ASHE:
Okay.
What do you think you have to bring to this role?

RICH:
Not much.
I think I look the part.
People tell me I look quite similar to Richard Evans.

DAVID ASHE:
I bet they tell you a lot of things.

RICH:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
What percent body fat are you?

RICH:
90, 95%?
Is that...
Yeah.
That's about right.

DAVID ASHE:
Wanna change that answer?

RICH:
80%?

DAVID ASHE:
Okay.
Have you prepared a scene for us today?

RICH:
Yeah.
I can do any scene but the boobery scenes.
I've, I've got a condition where, uh, if I fall down, I'll die.

DAVID ASHE:
I want you to fall down.

RICH:
You want me to fall down?

DAVID ASHE:
I'm sure you'll be okay.

RICH:
You sure?

DAVID ASHE:
Medicine's a crock.
Uh, go over there.

RICH:
I'm gonna try a Rich Evans-style, uh, pratfall now.

DAVID ASHE:
All right.
I want, I want you to play this one with hatred.

RICH:
Hatred.

DAVID ASHE:
All right.
Whenver you're ready, go.

RICH:
Grrr!
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, my god.
That's terrible.

RICH:
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
I've seen better Rich Evans crawl out of a toilet.
Uh, get up.
Get up.

RICH:
I fell!
I fell!

DAVID ASHE:
Yes.
I'm, uh, sure you did.

RICH:
I fell.

DAVID ASHE:
Have you ever seen Rich Evans' film, Gorilla Interrupted?

RICH:
Yes, I have.
It's, it's a masterpiece.

DAVID ASHE:
I want you to make up a monologue that you think captures the Rich Evans experience in Gorilla Interrupted.

RICH:
Ow!
Ow, my...groin?
What?
What?
Ow, my...groin?
Ow, my...groin?
Liver?
Do I get the part?

DAVID ASHE:
No.
Get the hell out of here.
Next.

RICH:
Joe Vacc?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Yeah?

RICH:
Okay.
You've just walked into a room.

JOE VACCARIELO:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
You are Richard Evans.

JOE VACCARIELO:
Okay.

RICH:
There are too many bagels.
Now, go!

JOE VACCARIELO:
What is wrong with all these bagels?
I wanted only one bagel!
I mean, I see a dozen here!
Look at this.

DAVID ASHE:
You've just been hit on the spine by a bat.

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
Bagels!
Spine and bat bagels.
Spine and bat bagels!
Go!

JOE VACCARIELO:
Spine and bat...
What?

RICH:
Joe, you've been playing me for two minutes now, and you've only said "what" twice.
What is wrong?
What?
What?
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

RICH:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
Say it!

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What is wrong?

RICH:
You've just been hit a football.
What do you say?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Ow!

DAVID ASHE:
It's in the groin.

RICH:
"Ow", your what?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Ow, my groin!

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Ow, my groin.

DAVID ASHE:
Do you know anyone who does a worse Rich Evans than you?
My god.
This guy can do a better Rich Evans.

RICH:
I think we can work with this.

JOE VACCARIELO:
This guy was doing a good Joe Vacc!

RICH:
I can't audition for Joe Vacc.
I can't.

C.C. CHAPMAN:
Okay.
It's a time to chill.

JOE VACCARIELO:
It's a time to chill.
I'll do the movie if you give me the hookers.

JAY:
Wait, wait, wait.
We're talking about hookers here?
Where are the hookers?
Do we have...
There are no hookers?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Oh, shit.

DAVID ASHE:
If you get the party, you get hookers.

RICH:
I'm a hooker.

JAY:
Am I a...

DAVID ASHE:
There are too many bagels!

RICH:
When all else fails...
Oh!
I've fallen down!
I've fallen...
Oh!

GARRETT:
That's Rich Evans.
That's not Joe Vacc.

RICH:
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
Now fall up.
Fall up!

RICH:
Oh!
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
That's terrible.

LISA:
Go, Rich!

JAY:
Hello, Heather.

LISA:
What's up, Jim?

JAY:How was your first semester of college?

LISA:
Uh, not too bad.

JAY:
Really?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
What were you studying in?

LISA:
I was studying in film.

JAY:
Film?
Really?

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
Did you watch any interesting films?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
Not one?
I got a gun.

LISA:
Oh, my god!

JAY:
No, that's not threatening.
I was just telling you that I had a gun.

LISA:
Oh, you just had...
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah.

LISA:
Okay.

JAY:
Do you want to hold the gun?

LISA:
No.

GARRETT:
And...action.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
I'm a loose cannon.

JASON SANTO:
But you get the job done.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
I'm off the case.

JAY:
Henry, this is Heather.
Heather is in college.

LISA:
Nice to meet you, Henry.

MIKE:
Oh, Heather.

LISA:
Hi.

MIKE:
I've read so much about you.

LISA:
Yes.
What have you heard?

JAY:
Where did you read something about her at?

MIKE:
Your book on beetles.

LISA:
Yes.

JAY:
Oh, the beetle book.
I totally forgot you wrote that.

LISA:
The first edition.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Chapter four.
How to eat beetles with macaroni salad.

LISA:
Did you like that one, or...
Have you tried it?

MIKE:
I tried it, and I vomited.
All over myself and others.

LISA:
It's not for everyone, but...

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
Can we assign me an off-beat partner?
Maybe a dog that drools a lot?

JASON SANTO:
Your new partner's over here.

MAN WITH GLASSES:
But I don't like any of you.

JONASON HO:
Why, I think it's all fucked.
Fucked.
Fucked.
Fucked.
And fucked.

JASON SANTO:
That's where you're wrong my friend.

JONASON HO:
Am I?
Am I?

JASON SANTO:
That's where you're wrong, my friend!
That's where you're wrong!

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
Aughhh!

MIKE:
So, I read something.

JAY:
You said...
You said you'd...

MIKE:
Excuse me.
So I hear there's some ghosts around.

LISA:
Really?
I hadn't heard that yet.

JAY:
Wait, what?
Ghosts?

LISA:
Ghosts.

MIKE:
It's the legend here in this town, is that an old ghost who used to be a miner is coming back to mine.

JASON SANTO:
Drop the case.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
I'm off the case.

JASON SANTO:
You're off the case.

JONASON HO:
So sad.
So sad.
Your dad will be very mad.

JASON SANTO:
Poor bastard.

MAN WITH GLASSES:
I don't like this.
I don't like any of us.
I don't like me.
I don't like any...

JONASON HO:
Shut the fuck up!

JASON SANTO:
Crap.

MAN WITH GLASSES:
I don't like your tone of voice.

JONASON HO:
Shut up!
Why don't you get together...

JASON SANTO:
Crap.

JONASON HO:
Well, maybe you guys can work in a cell a little better or something.
A loose cannon.
I mean, so what?
There's a lot of things...
You know what I'm saying?
So you guys should just get together and have, like, a barbeque or something.
And things will be okay.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
I'm a loose cannon.

JASON SANTO:
But you get the job done.

JONASON HO:
Cocksucker.
Cocksucking what?
Sucker?
Fuck you.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
I'm a loose cannon.

JASON SANTO:
But you get results.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
Look!
He's doing something bad!

JONASON HO:
That's one fucked up dude right there.

JASON SANTO:
Crap.

MIKE:
Listen, um...
I've got some birdwatching to do.

JAY:
Hey, Heather.

LISA:
What's up, Jim?

JAY:
Hey, Heather.

LISA:
What's up, Jim?

JAY:
I'm gonna go over there now.

MIKE:
Garrett, this is terible.

LISA:
Garrett, is this what you wanted?
It's terr...

DAVID ASHE:
All right.
Welcome.
We've called you out here for the audition for...

GARRETT:
Thank you.

DAVID ASHE:
Don't talk.
We've called you out here for the audition for Some Call It Cum.

GARRETT:
I'm gonna be a porno Jesus.

DAVID ASHE:
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Okay.
Okay.

GARRETT:
You're shooting a movie?
My name is Garrett Gilchrist.
I make movie.
See, I say "movie" like a cow.
I've got a company called Orange Cow Productions.
We make moo-vies.
I'm from Monroe, Connecticut.
The film capital of the world.

DAVID ASHE:
Are you willing to take your shirt off?

GARRETT:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
No!
Don't!
Please!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Uh, you're very good.
Uh, we like what you're doing.
Uh, that's...

GARRETT:
I make Star Wars movies.
I've got a light-'em-a-saber.
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Moo-vace.
I like Phantom Menace.
This was the greatest of the Star Wars films.
I was not in this film.
We made a movie in my backyard about The Phantom Menace.
It was called The Phantom Movie.

DAVID ASHE:
Shut up.

GARRETT:
Phantom Moo-vie.
I...
Is this a porno?

DAVID ASHE:
Wait.
Hold on.

GARRETT:
Is this a porno?
My mother doesn't let me do pornos.

DAVID ASHE:
Don't talk.

GARRETT:
I was in a Jay Bauman movie.
I played Jesus.
I was fucking a girl.
Something I've never done in actual real life.
But it was fun.
That's why they call it acting.

DAVID ASHE:
Shut up.

GARRETT:
That's why they call it acting.

DAVID ASHE:
Look, um...
Don't, don't talk, all right?

GARRETT:
Okay.

DAVID ASHE:
Do you have a scene prepared for us?

GARRETT:
Yeah?
No?
Yeah.
I have prepared a scene from the greatest motion picture ever written: Excaliburger (or, the Spatula in the Stone).
Okay.
Here's how it goes.
"I'm not your squire!"
"You're my squire!"
"You got that?"

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, my god.
This is...

GARRETT:
"My voice isn't irritating!"
Okay.
In that scene, the bush was playing Michelle Caruso, who was in my movie Excaliburger (or, the Spatula in the Stone), who is up for Best Supporting Actress at the Retard Video Awards in South Demakota, the film capital of the world.
Besides Monroe, Connecticut, of course.
I lost part of my...

DAVID ASHE:
Mr. Gilchrist, um...
A contemporary of yours, uh, Mr. Guy McConnell, has called you one of the hottest up-and-coming filmmakers in the industry.
What do you have to say about that?

GARRETT:
He thinks I'm sexy?
I wish...

DAVID ASHE:
Um...

GARRETT:
He thinks I'm sexy?
He's, he's the first person who's ever called me sexy.
I don't know want to sound like a queer or nothing, but Guy McConnell's hot.
I make movies!
See, it's "moo-vies" like a cow!
For Orange Cow Productions!

DAVID ASHE:
Uh, we got that.
Look, um...
Do you have any, uh, plans for the immediate future of your filmmaking career?

GARRETT:
Yes.
I am making a serious four-hour character drama about life and love in Los Angeles.
I make movies!
I am a serious film-a ma-maker.

DAVID ASHE:
Wow.
That's...
I bet your mother's very proud of you.

GARRETT:
My mother beats me.
Hard.
With pieces of the toilet.

DAVID ASHE:
Um...
Could you, could you get that out of your mouth.

GARRETT:
You're cute.

DAVID ASHE:
Um...
Please don't hump that.
Please.

GARRETT:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.

GARRETT:
I've got a light-a-ma-saber.
I like women.

DAVID ASHE:
We all do.

GARRETT:
Women give me erect-a-mions.

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, my...

GARRETT:
Where am I?
Where the fuck is this?

DAVID ASHE:
Why don't you go wander around for a while?
I bet you'll find some treasure.

GARRETT:
I love Jesus.

DAVID ASHE:
Thank god he's going.
Call in the next guy.

GARRETT:
The hills are alive with the sound of moo-vies.

DAVID ASHE:
You know what?
Just fuck it.
Give me the handgun.
Oh, he's coming back...
Fuck.
Um...
Hey.
Look over there!
It's, uh...
Oh, god.
He's coming behind the table.
Don't, don't touch me there.
Oh, my god!
That's your pe-...
Oh, my god!

GARRETT:
I like women.

DAVID ASHE:
Something funny about the wilderness.
It brings out everything you hate about yourself.
I stare at the rocks, and you know what I see?
I see myself with a huge erection.
Well, no.
I don't see that.
Well, I see that, too.
What I see is black.
The blackness of man's hearts.
I just started with me wearing lingeries.
I didn't think it would turn into this.
John.
John.
What are you building?
They outlawed machines for a reason, John.
Do you want another war?
What are branches looking for?
Why do they branch out?
What the fuck do they want?
It's coming.
Inspiration.
The greatest story I've ever heard.
Yes, I can see it all now.
Cinema.
Theater.
Novels.
Yes.
It'll be about sand.
It's so clear now.
I'll make millions.
All on sand.
If only they knew it was just millions of little grains.
It's not just sand.
I just want my uncle to love me.
Why did he do those things?
I didn't wanna play Risk.
He always got South America.
South America was my favorite.
And I never did understand what the cannon pieces were for.
You know what my father used to say?
A hatchet is never just a hatchet.
It's so many things.
A weapon.
A tool
An anniversary gift.
Eww.
Oh, that's really nasty.
I think I'll do it again.
Tastes like pineapple.
I could really go for some pineapple.
Do you think there's any pineapple in those bushes, John?
Huh?
You're precious bushes that you don't want me to hurt?
Well, maybe you should've done a better job of protecting them.
Man, that's yellow.
Nothing like a good yellow piss.
So what are we cooking here?
You know what really pisses me off, John?
When things don't work like they're supposed to.
It makes me really mad, John.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Hey.
Hey.
Stop it.
Stop...
Aw, geez.

DAVID ASHE:
I just wanted to make some art.
Isn't this so pretty?
Too bad it doesn't bleed, because blood is really pretty.
You know what really pisses me off, John?
When people don't like my art.
That really gets my bear.
It really gets my bear!
Oh, god!
A bear!
An innocent little rock.
You know how the human heart can be.
Even rocks aren't safe from evil.
Man, I suck at evil.
It's not easy being insane.
It's really hard to scare others sometime.
It makes me cry.
It makes me weep.
I think I just can't go on.
But then I remember something a friend once told me.
Satan, yeah!
Yeah, he's Satan.
Yeah.
He made me do lots of evil deeds.
Yes, Satan!
He's freaking Sat-, Sat-, Sat-, Sat-, Satan.
He's my friend.
One day I was walking down the street.
Walk, walk, walk, walk.
I was walking down the street.
Yeah, yeah.
And who comes up to me but Mr. Satan?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan.
What did he say to me?
He said...
"Hey, hey jackass."
"Pull up your pants."
"Don't touch yourself there."
"There's more important things in life for you."
"You?"
"Yes, evil!"
Evil is what you need.
You gotta give in.
You gotta give in.
You gotta give in.
Gotta give in to Satan!
Yes, Sat-, Sat-, Sat-...
Sat-freaking-an.
He's evil!

GARRETT:
Wait a minute.
My psychic superpowers have detected a terrible evil.
Somebody is making a sequel to Ghostbusted!
No-o-o-o-o!
That's the sound of my head exploding.
And...action!
Rich, run!
You're action-packed.

RICH:
I'm here to kill you.

DAVID ASHE:
And I'm here to kill you.

RICH:
Jimmy sent me.

DAVID ASHE:
Wait a minute.
They set us up to kill each other.

RICH:
Jimmy sent us to kill each other as part of a complicated plot.
What was he gonna do if I shot you and you died, and then you couldn't shoot me?
I think Jimmy's plot is flawed.

DAVID ASHE:
Let's go.

RICH:
Do we really need to bother?

DAVID ASHE:
No, let's go, uh...

RICH:
We can get some bagels.

DAVID ASHE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Okay.

DAVID ASHE:
I like bagels.

RICH:
Oh!
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
Ah!
Fuck!
You asshole!
You just shot me!
Goddamitt!

RICH:
You know, I'm a professional.

DAVID ASHE:
Gimme that, you goddamn asshole.
How do you like it?

RICH:
Ow!
My groin!

DAVID ASHE:
That's not your...

RICH:
Oh, heart!
Heart!
Ow, my heart!

DAVID ASHE:
Shit.
Fuck.

RICH:
You son of a bitch.
I'm giving you the Gods of L.A. now.

DAVID ASHE:
I don't want that crap.

RICH:
Here.

DAVID ASHE:
Get it away from me.

RICH:
Why aren't we dying?

DAVID ASHE:
I don't know.

RICH:
I don't feel inured anymore.
I think I'm okay.

DAVID ASHE:
I'm feeling nauseous.

RICH:
Okay.
Oh, no!

DAVID ASHE:
You still wanna get a bagel?

RICH:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
Let's, let's go get a bagel.

LISA:
Go, Rich!

JAY:
Yay, Rich!

LISA:
All right!

JAY:
It's one year later, Rich!

LISA:
Whoo!

JAY:
I now have a gun and a basketball.
Oh!
Joe!
What are you doing here, Joe?

MIKE:
Hi.
Hi.
I know.

JAY:
I bought this for you.

MIKE:
Oh, thanks
You know, I found that ghost.

JAY:
That ghost that you told us about one year ago?

LISA:
I think...
Yeah, last year you said something about...

MIKE:
He came right out riding out on his translucent horse.
He got off and went towards the...
And I pulled...

JAY:
What kind of horse was it?

LISA:
It was translucent.
How fun.

MIKE:
Fear me.
Anyways.
Um...
What's, what's been going on with you two?

LISA:
Not very much.

JAY:
You're still in school?
Is it still for film?

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
Have you watched anything interesting yet?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
Not one?

MIKE:
You know, I was on, on the underground railroad.

JAY:
Really.

LISA:
You've never said that before.

JAY:
You never told me about that, Joe.

MIKE:
Well, I, I, I was the conductor.

DAVID ASHE:
Look!
Ninjas!
Vikings?
Viking ninjas?
Bears!
The viking ninjas are riding the bears!

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Oh, no.
I broke Dave.
He'll get reading?
Ready?

DAVID ASHE:
Okay.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Oh, no.
I broke Dave.

DAVID ASHE:
Don't say "oh, no".
Just say "I broke Dave".

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I broke Dave.

DAVID ASHE:
I broked it.
Yes.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Here we go.
Okay.
Ready?
Ready?
Ready.
Okay, ready?

DAVID ASHE:
Mm-hmm.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
All right.
Ready?
We're gonna do it.

DAVID ASHE:
Do it.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
We can do it.
Okay, ready?
All right.
I broke Dave.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I emphasized the wrong word.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
I broke Dave.

DAVID ASHE:
John.
Gimme...
Just do it...
The one you did before is fine.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I think what I'm doing right now is genius.

DAVID ASHE:
Okay.
That's great.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Okay.
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?
I broke Dave.
No, wait a minute.
No, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.
I put the emphasis...

DAVID ASHE:
If you're gonna deliver it wrong, just give me a pause afterwards so I can use it, okay?

JOHN BRUGMANN:
All right.
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?
I broke Dave...
No.
Wait.
No.
That's not how you break Dave.
Hold on.
Okay.
Ready?

DAVID ASHE:
You get one more shot, then I'm turning this off.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
All right.
What was my other line, though?
What was my other line?

GARRETT:
Say "Look out, ghost!"

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Look out, ghost!

GARRETT:
No, no, no.
"Look out, ghost"...

DAVID ASHE:
"Look out, ghost!"
Like...
"Look out!"
"Ghost!"

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

GARRETT:
You're not talking to the ghost.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Lookout, ghost!
Like that?

GARRETT:
You're still not talking to the ghost.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?
Ready?

DAVID ASHE:
John, I hope you find this funny.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I find this really funny, actually. 
Ready?
Look out...Dave?
Come on, that was hilarious.

GARRETT:
Okay.
I, I...

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I put the emphasis on the wrong words like I was ta-...

GARRETT:
John.
I want you to sing a song now.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Now?
I can't sing it here.
I can't, I can't sing right now.

GARRETT:
Go.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I can't.

GARRETT:
Sing.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
No, I...
No, I broke Dave.
Look out, ghost.
Look out, Dave.
I broke ghost.
Here.
Give it here.
i broke Dave.

GARRETT:

No.
Sing.
Sing about breaking Dave.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Sing about breaking Dave.

GARRETT:
I broke Dave.
I really broke Dave now.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Come here.
Come here.

GARRETT:
What?

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I broke Dave.

GARRETT:
Jazzier.
Faster.
Faster tempo.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Ready?
Ready?

GARRETT:
Much faster.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Ready?
Ready?

GARRETT:
Melodic.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Ready?
Ready?

GARRETT:
Go.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
How long can I do this before I get fed up by it?
Okay, that's enough.

GARRETT:
Okay, this is Dave.
Broken.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
I did that.
I broke Dave.
Dave.
Look out.
Ghost.

DAVID ASHE:
Ghost.
What bit is going nowhere?
Might it be this one?

LISA:
I've never been to Mount Rushmore before.
What's up with all this crap?
I don't understand the big deal.
I mean, what's up with...
It's just kind of a rock.

JAY:
It's a big pile of rocks in the shapes of, of presidents, you see.

LISA:
Oh!

JAY:
You know, you know, presidents?

LISA:
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I get...
So...

JAY:
You've heard of those?
See, there's...

LISA:
Who is what?
I...

JAY:
Well, that's, that's George Washington.
That's Thomas Jefferson.

LISA:
Okay.

JAY:
That's Thomas Edison.

LISA:
All right.

JAY:
And that's Abraham Lincoln.

LISA:
Thomas Edison?

JAY:
And that's Batman.

LISA:
Batman?

JAY:
And Susan B. Anthony's on the other side.

LISA:
I'm not seeing...
I'm not seeing that, but...
Okay.

JAY:
No, there are...
Some of them are on the other side.

LISA:
So there's a whole...
Why can't we see that?

JAY:
Well, we gotta take a trail.
There's a path.

LISA:
And I, I thought that...
I don't think that's Thomas Edison.
That third one?

JAY:
That's, that third one is Thomas Edison.
You can tell by the moustache.

LISA:
Right.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

RICH:
Vacance.

JAY:
Exactly.

LISA:
Oh.
Look.
See, I never, I've never seen it on the information, yeah, videos.

JAY:
Madonna?
Is that Madonna?

OLD MAN:
That's Madonna.

JAY:
Oh, I was, I was thinking it was Abraham Lincoln.

LISA:
Really?

JAY:
It might be Madonna.

LISA:
Thanks, sir.

OLD MAN:
Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Madonna.
That's...

LISA:
Thank you for your help.

OLD MAN:
It's equality for the women and all, you know?

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

LISA:
We didn't know what was going on.

OLD MAN:
We gotta have Madonna up there.

JAY:
Oh, I feel stupid now.

LISA:
Yeah, yeah.

OLD MAN:
Yeah, well, what can I say?

JAY:
Thank, thank you very much, sir.

OLD MAN:
My job is to clarify things.

JAY:
Good.
I'm glad your here.

LISA:
So, Madon-...
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah.

LISA:
It makes so much more sense.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

RICH:
Aren't they astronauts?
I thought that one was Buzz Aldrin.

LISA:
No, Rich.

JAY:
No, no, no, no.
Buzz Aldrin...
That's down the street.

LISA:
Yeah.

RICH:
Buzz Sherman, and...

LISA:
Rich, no.
No.

JAY:
Hey, look!
Ninjas!

LISA:
Wow.

RICH:
They just changed to the ninjas.

LISA:
Yeah.

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
Man people worked on Mount Rushmore.
I, I remember them all very well.
There was, uh...

JAY:
Excuse me?

JONATHAN MARGHEIM:
Yes?

JAY:
Didn't I see you in Spy Kids?

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
It's Michael Yebba.

JAY:
It's, it's Michael Yebba.

RICH:
Michael Yebba?

JAY:
From Spy Kids.

RICH:
I need your autograph.
I need your autograph.

JAY:
Michael Yebba's over here.
It's Michael Yebba.

RICH:
Michael Yebba.
He was in Spy Kids.

JAY:
He was...

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Oh, god.

JAY:
It's Michael Yebba.
Can I have your autograph, please?
I don't have a pen, but...

MIKE:
So, wait.

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Right here.

JAY:
Someone...
Do you have a pen?
A pen?
A pen?
A pen?

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Pen.

JAY:
Pen!

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Pen.

RICH:
You can sign my car keys.

MIKE:
The scene with the jetpack.
Was that hard to do, or...

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
The jetpack.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.
I didn't see the movie.
But that scene with the jetpack was awesome.

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Um, that was really hard to film because, um, we didn't have a jetpack or a scene, so...

JAY:
Okay.
Here we go.
I got on this piece of paper a girl's phone number that broke my heart, and I want you to autograph it.

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
You got it.

JAY:
Michael Yebba.

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Michael Yebba.

JAY:
Yeah.
Right below Ali.
She sucks.
It's Michael Yebba!

RICH:
Huntimer "Big Dick".

MIKE:
He left his bag.

JAY:
He left his bag.
Look it.
Michael Yebba's bag.
Let's go.

JONATHAN MORGHEIM:
Autograph.
Thank you.
Hey, that's my pen.
Where's my bag?

JAY:
How long have we been in this elevator?

MIKE:
I don't know.
Hours, it seems like.

JAY:
I know.
I'm, I'm starting to get cabin fever.

MIKE:
You know what...

LISA:
Is that water you have there, Sam?

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
There's a way out of here.

JAY:
No.
This isn't water.
Hey...
No, Joe, don't!

LISA:
Don't!

MIKE:
Oh, shoot.

JAY:
That was the way out.
You fucking asshole.
That was the way out of the elevator.
Who knows when the next time that, that...

LISA:
Goddammit, Tim.

JAY:
That door might never open...
No, putting a pillow in front of it isn't gonna help.

MIKE:
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was an accident again.

JAY:
You accidnetally put the pillow in front of our only way out?
Is that a way out?
Is that a way out?
Let's see if we can burn it it open.

MIKE:
It's not a good idea.
If there's a fire, then we're all dead.

JAY:
But it's cold in here.
Let's warm our hands on the fire.

MIKE:
Listen.

JAY:
Put your hands on the fire.

LISA:
What are you talking about?

JAY:
Put your hands on the fire.

MIKE:
Ma'am.
Listen.

LISA:
Sir.

MIKE:
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna lay this to you straight.

JAY:
Lay it to us straight, Jack.

LISA:
Yeah.
Lay it down.

MIKE:
I am an agent of a clandestine government agency known as the FWO.

JAY:
The FWO?
Is that some kind of wrestling thing, or...

MIKE:
No.

LISA:
I think it is.
Like, on, on TBS, they have, like, WCW...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
No, no, no, no, no.
That, that, that, that's...

JAY:
They hit chairs over each other's heads.

MIKE:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

JAY:
No?

MIKE:
I can't explain to you.
It's about...
All I can explain to you is that, um, this elevator will begin crushing itself in a very short amount of time.

JAY:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

LISA:
What are you...

JAY:
I just wanted to document the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
That's not true.
You're full of it.

LISA:
Yep.

MIKE:
Sir, before this night is over, that camera will be destroyed.

JAY:
But this is my camera.

LISA:
Now, FWO...what does that stand for?

MIKE:
Ma'am.

JAY:
I've got pictures of, of Cancun on this roll.
You can't destroy this.

MIKE:
Ma'am.

LISA:
Sir.

MIKE:
Sir.

LISA:
Sir.

MIKE:
I don't c-...
Ma'am.

LISA:
Sir.

JAY:
Sir.

MIKE:
Listen.

LISA:
Temple of Doom.

MIKE:
Sir, I've been drinking.

JAY:
I'm sure you've seen it.

MIKE:
Ma'am, there's limited time.
There's...

JAY:
Wait, wait.
No, I, I...

MIKE:
Sir.

LISA:
Because remember, the elevator's gonna crush us.

MIKE:
Ma'am, there is limited time.
Let me explain to you the scene that involves the spikes that come through the room and it crushes.
That will begin to happen to this elevator very shortly.

JAY:
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

LISA:
Right.
Because you can start to see the spikes, yeah.

MIKE:
Ma'am, I've been in this elevator before, and I'm aware of what type of building we are in.

JAY:
You, your stories seems like bullshit to me, Joe.

MIKE:
Listen.

JAY:
Joe.

LISA:
Sherman.

JAY:
Joe.

LISA:
Stop the lie.
"Underground railroad"?

MIKE:
I've spent far too many nights in a can factory to listen to this.

LISA:
Can factory now, Sherman.

MIKE:
Fuck off.

LISA:
Oh!
Okay.

MIKE:
Oh, okay.

JAY:
It's a good thing I still have this gun, Joe.

LISA:
Sherman, see you later.

JAY:
You're ebing very rude to Mary Beth.

MIKE:
Look, Jack.
You may have been on the Titanic...
But, um, you know...
I wasn't the iceberg.
If you don't get that analogy, then you're just stupid pants.

JAY:
You do realize I have a gun pointed right at your heart.

MIKE:
It is not a real gun.

JAY:
It is...

MIKE:
It is a fake fiberglass impression of one.

DAN GORGONE:
I need bagels.
I, I need bagels.
You, you have, you have to tell me where the bagels are.

RICH:
Garrett Gilchrist.
He has the bagels.
Okay?

DAN GORGONE:
What?
Am I looking for bagels again?

RICH:
Where are, where are his bagels?
He's got them...
He's got them in here.
Let's find his bagels.

MIKE:
Please stop that.
Don't do that.

RICH:
Those are the bagels.

DAN GORGONE:
It kind of reminds me of the time that Carrie came to the ship, and she was shooting an interview for me.
And there was an authentic teak deck.
And they haven't cleaned it in years, so it looks terrible.
So then real Navy guys would come out and they would say it looks like crap.
But I know what it really would look like.
It looks white.

RICH:
There are no bagels in here.

DAN GORGONE:
Kind of bagel-shaped, so it really looked good.

JOE VACCARELLI:
Wait.
Garrett, get this.
Get this.
He's got me to a T.
Keep going.

DAN GORGONE:
It would look good.
But I need bagel.

RICH:
Plog.
Plog.

DAN GORGONE:
Hey.
Do you have bagels?

RICH:
Uh-huh.

DAN GORGONE:
That's tasty.
That would be tastier with cream cheese.
Possibly chives.
Did you know that chives are diced?
Diced.
Makes them easier to eat.
Easier to eat.
Is that a Sony?
Did you know how many Sony cameras Foo has?
Many.
Many.
More than two.
More than two.
Do you know that many famous people have hanged themselves?
It's really...
Did you know that Babe Ruth wore a cabbage leaf under his hat to stay cool while playing baseball?
This is interesting.
You're not very talkative, are you?
