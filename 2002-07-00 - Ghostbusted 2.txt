DAVID ASHE:
If someone had corn on the cob for breakfast, and then took a shit, the little chunks of the corn would still be in their shit, right?
You'd have the log.
Inside the log would be kernels of corn.
Undigested.
That was their breakfast.
Now let's suppose you go over to this piece of shit and pick out the kernels of corn and eat them yourself.
Did you eat their breakfast?
What the fuck is that?
What's the fucking answer for that?
How the fuck are you supposed to live when you can eat someone else's breakfast?
I'm tired.

JAY:
You do realize this is gonna be the worst thing ever made here, right?

TALL MAN WITH GLASSES (MARC LINN?):
Is it a Ghostbusted 2?
Yeah?

GARRETT:
Action.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
The ending credits come up, and the first thing that starts off is it's a picture of me.
And I go, and I go, and I go, and I go,
"Look out!"
"Ghost!"
Like that, right?
And then, and then, like -- BOOM! -- the main title comes up on the screen.
The movie starts with me explaining how to start the movie.
And then you cut the thing that I explained about.

DAVID ASHE:
So, like, what we're talking about right now is gonna be the movie?

JOHN BRUGMANN:
This...

DAVID ASHE:
Our conversation is the fucking movie!
That's fucking brilliant!
I'm taking off my pants.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my fucking god.

JAY:
You know, Lisa?
It's really great being here in South Dakota	and everything for this festival.
But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I really really wanna kill a man.
I've never done it before.
I mean, surprising, I've never done it before.

LISA:
You wanna kill someone?

JAY:
Yeah, I mean...

LISA:
A man...
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah, a man.
Not a woman.

LISA:
Jay, where is this coming from?
Nowhere?
I mean, I have stange fantasies and illusions, too.
But I don't tell everyone I wanna hug an elephant.
And I do, but...

JAY:
You wanna hug an elephant?

LISA:
Let's get back to you wanna kill a man, Jay?

JAY:
I mean, I'd like to kill a man.
It's just...

LISA:
Really?

JAY:
Oh.
Hi.

MIKE:
Hi.

JAY:
What's going on?

MIKE:
Oh.
I changed my name to Albert.

JAY:
Albert?
What made you decide to do that?
But it was still...

MIKE:
I changed my last name, Albert, to Finney.

LISA:
Albert Finney?

MIKE:
I was in the bathroom, and I saw a ghost.

JAY:
Seriously?

LISA:
Oh, this is, this is great.
This is great.

MIKE:
I've been going around telling everybody not to use that particular restroom.

LISA:
Yep.

JAY:
I mean...

MIKE:
Well, I haven't been in the other restrooms.

LISA:
Would it, would it...
Was it a he?
Was it a she?
What did it look like?

JAY:
Did you get...
Yeah, what did it look like?

MIKE:
Well...
It was kind of androgynous.
It was like, uh, you know, with the, with the...

JAY:
Like Dennis Rodman?
Like, you don't know what's going on up there.

MIKE:
No, but it didn't look like Dennis Rodman.
It looked like a quivering, uh, mass of tentacles and glowing energy...

JAY:
You know, Mike?
I'm gonna be honest with you here.
I mean, it's, it's great to see you and everything.
Or, Albert.
I'm sorry.

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
But we, we kind of were having an important conversation before you came in.

MIKE:
Oh!

JAY:
Kind of interrupting something here.

MIKE:
Um, well...

LISA:
No, he's not.

JAY:
No, he is.

LISA:
Why don't you tell him what you wanna do, Jay?

JAY:
Oh, okay.
Well, here's the thing.
I, I really really want to kill a man.
Can you understand that?

MIKE:
A man, or...

LISA:
Listen to this.

JAY:
A man.

MIKE:
Well, who?

JAY:
I don't really know yet.

LISA:
Does that really matter?
He wants to kill a man.

MIKE:
Well, it does matter.

LISA:
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
If it's some guy from China, I don't care.

LISA:
Okay.

MIKE:
If it's someone from China...

JAY:
Wait, wait.
China.
You, what do you got against the Chinese?

MIKE:
Nothing.
There's just a lot of 'em.
If it's some guy...

JAY:
Well, I don't...

LISA:
What if it's you, Albert?
Is it okay then?
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, then I'd, I'd be, I'd be very interested knowing.
 
JAY:
Yeah.
It's a good thing it's not you that I wanna kill.

MIKE:
Oh.
Listen, I just came to warn you guys.

JAY:
Well, I really appreciate that.

LISA:
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

JAY:
And it's, you know, I really appreciate that you come to us first.

MIKE:
Let me tell you.
You know when you go down...

LISA:
Warn us from the tentacle...
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.

JAY:
So it's a really good thing that I don't wanna murder you.

LISA:
Thanks, Mike.
Albert.

JAY:
Because if I wanted to murder you, then, then I feel bad that you just came in and, and told us this information and warned us when the fact is, all I wanna do is kill you.
That'd be, I, I'd be coming off like an asshole, you know?
So that's...
It's a good thing that's not the case.
Are you all right?
What was that?

LISA:
Is that...
Are you okay?

MIKE:
What was what?

JAY:
What you just did.
What was that?
You, you did a little jerk movement, like...

LISA:
You did a little, like, spastic...

JAY:
It looked like someone, you know, hooked a car battery up to your testicles.

MIKE:
Holy shit.

JAY:
What?
I don't see anything.
Wait.
Are you all right?

LISA:
He's doing it!
What are you doing?

MIKE:
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

LISA:
Right.

JAY:
Well, then maybe you should just leave.

LISA:
Isn't it ironic...

MIKE:
Jesus, fuck me!

JAY:
Did you hear that?

LISA:
Yes!

JAY:
Why did you just say that to us?

LISA:
What the hell was that?

JAY:
Why did you say that to us?

MIKE:
What are you talking about?
Listen, I've been getting creeped out...

JAY:
That was vulgar.

MIKE:
I really think this film festival is haunted.

LISA:
What the hell is wrong with you?

JAY:
Well...

MIKE:
Listen, you guys are creeping me out.
The door is opening by itself, and...

JAY:
Oh, my gosh.

DAVID ASHE:
Ajar, here!
Stop.
I have to...
You can't touch my lightsaber.
It cuts you.

MIKE:
Cut.
Cut!

JAY:
So did Mike seema  little weird to you?

LISA:
Yeah.
I don't...
He's been like that lately.

JAY:
I mean...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

DAVID ASHE:
Hey!

LISA:
Hey, what's up?

DAVID ASHE:
How's it going?

LISA:
Good.

JAY:
Oh, I recognize you.
You were in that, that one movie, right?

DAVID ASHE:
So what's up?

LISA:
Nothing.

JAY:
Hey.
I recognize...

DAVID ASHE:
Do you like the pillows?

LISA:
I do, actually.
Thanks.

JAY:
No, you were in that one movie with the, the...
You had the beard on.

LISA:
You had a beard in a movie?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
No, no.
Those are my pillows.
Can I have my pillows back?
They're soft, and I like to switch them...

DAVID ASHE:
She like pillows.

LISA:
Thank you.

JAY:
Wait.
Why are...

DAVID ASHE:
What's your name?

LISA:
Uh, you don't...
Lisa.

DAVID ASHE:
Wonderful meeting you.

LISA:
Thanks.

DAVID ASHE:
Do you like Jedi?

LISA:
Jedi?

DAVID ASHE:
I love Jedi.
This is my lightsaber.

LISA:
Is it really?

JAY:
That's a piece of plastic.
That's so stupid.

DAVID ASHE:
It's only too stupid.
So shut the fuck up.

JAY:
No, that's not a real lightsaber.
She's not gonna fall for that, okay?
That's so dumb.

LISA:
Actually, can I see it?
Can I see it?

DAVID ASHE:
You wanna see how it works?

LISA:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
See, she wants to...

LISA:
Can I see it?

DAVID ASHE:
Isn't that awesome?

LISA:
That...

DAVID ASHE:
You wanna hold it?

LISA:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
I bet you're really good with it.

LISA:
I bet I am.

DAVID ASHE:
You need another pillow, I think.

JAY:
If you took that pillow off...
That's my pillow!
That's my fucking pillow!
You don't look very comfortable.
You got pillows all over you.
You look stupid.
He's making you look stupid.
Why are you putting up with this?

LISA:
Jay.

DAVID ASHE:
Isn't he being a little...

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's making you look stupid.

LISA:
He's like this often, too.

JAY:
I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of you here.
I don't, I don't want him to make you look stupid.

LISA:
You're telling me I look stupid, though.

JAY:
He's making you look stupid, though.
If it wasn't for him, you'd look just fine.

LISA:
Fine.
Just stop it, Jay.
I can't...

JAY:
Aughhh!
You're hitting me with your shoe.
Ow!
My shoulder!

DAVID ASHE:
Spain and coat as a puckle.

JAY:
Oh!
Fuck!
Water puddle!

DAVID ASHE:
Ah!
God!

JAY:
You could've crushed my hat!

DAVID ASHE:
I lost control.
The Jedi shall not know anger.
The Jedi shall not know anger.

JAY:
Murder him!

MAN IN FLORAL SHIRT:
It's okay!

DAVID ASHE:
Aughhh!

MAN IN FLORAL SHIRT:
It's okay!

DAVID ASHE:
Aughhh!

MAN IN FLORAL SHIRT:
It's okay!
It's okay!

JAY:
Oh, oh.
Do you hear that?
It's okay.
Let's go back out to the festival.
It'll be fun.

LISA:
God.

JAY:
We're gonna take his lightsaber, though.

LISA:
I bet you Deathlist is playing by now.

JAY:
Oh!
Oh, we don't wanna miss that.

LISA:
Goddammit.
We missed it.

DAVID ASHE:
What the fuck?
My asshole.
It looks like someone got shit all over your coat.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
That's disgusting.

DAVID ASHE:
Yeah.
What the hell is this crap?
Blood?
Someone have their period all over this?
Ugh!
Man, this is ever worse than that time I refrained from masturbating for three months.
I betcha it went 20 feet.
I'd kill someone if I shot that off inside of him.
God, I rock.
Someone's gonna be fucking pissed off.
Well, fuck you, man.
Fuck you, man.
No!
No!
Aughhh!
Aughhh!
Aughhh!
I'm gonna go take a shower now.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Clean up your freaking shampoo that exploded.
Look at this.
Somebody could slip in this and die.

DAVID ASHE:
Consume!
Consume!
Consume!
Consume!
Motherfucker!
Fucker!
Oh, fuck this!
Huh?
What?
What just happened?
It was like staring into the mouth of hell itself.
Let's go play Mario Bros 2!

DAVID ASHE:
Hi.
Uh, please state your name.

RICH:
Richard William Thomas, uh, Michael.

DAVID ASHE:
And you are trying out for the part of Rich Evans?

RICH:
Richard William Thomas Evans.
Correct.

DAVID ASHE:
Okay.
What do you think you have to bring to this role?

RICH:
Not much.
I think I look the part.
People tell me I look quite similar to Richard Evans.

DAVID ASHE:
I bet they tell you a lot of things.

RICH:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
What percent body fat are you?

RICH:
90, 95%?
Is that...
Yeah.
That's about right.

DAVID ASHE:
Wanna change that answer?

RICH:
80%?

DAVID ASHE:
Okay.
Have you prepared a scene for us today?

RICH:
Yeah.
I can do any scene but the boobery scenes.
I've, I've got a condition where, uh, if I fall down, I'll die.

DAVID ASHE:
I want you to fall down.

RICH:
You want me to fall down?

DAVID ASHE:
I'm sure you'll be okay.

RICH:
You sure?

DAVID ASHE:
Medicine's a crock.
Uh, go over there.

RICH:
I'm gonna try a Rich Evans-style, uh, pratfall now.

DAVID ASHE:
All right.
I want, I want you to play this one with hatred.

RICH:
Hatred.

DAVID ASHE:
All right.
Whenver you're ready, go.

RICH:
Grrr!
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, my god.
That's terrible.

RICH:
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
I've seen better Rich Evans crawl out of a toilet.
Uh, get up.
Get up.

RICH:
I fell!
I fell!

DAVID ASHE:
Yes.
I'm, uh, sure you did.

RICH:
I fell.

DAVID ASHE:
Have you ever seen Rich Evans' film, Gorilla Interrupted?

RICH:
Yes, I have.
It's, it's a masterpiece.

DAVID ASHE:
I want you to make up a monologue that you think captures the Rich Evans experience in Gorilla Interrupted.

RICH:
Ow!
Ow, my...groin?
What?
What?
Ow, my...groin?
Ow, my...groin?
Liver?
Do I get the part?

DAVID ASHE:
No.
Get the hell out of here.
Next.

RICH:
Joe Vacc?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Yeah?

RICH:
Okay.
You've just walked into a room.

JOE VACCARIELO:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
You are Richard Evans.

JOE VACCARIELO:
Okay.

RICH:
There are too many bagels.
Now, go!

JOE VACCARIELO:
What is wrong with all these bagels?
I wanted only one bagel!
I mean, I see a dozen here!
Look at this.

DAVID ASHE:
You've just been hit on the spine by a bat.

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
Bagels!
Spine and bat bagels.
Spine and bat bagels!
Go!

JOE VACCARIELO:
Spine and bat...
What?

RICH:
Joe, you've been playing me for two minutes now, and you've only said "what" twice.
What is wrong?
What?
What?
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

RICH:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
Say it!

JOE VACCARIELO:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
What is wrong?

RICH:
You've just been hit a football.
What do you say?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Ow!

DAVID ASHE:
It's in the groin.

RICH:
"Ow", your what?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Ow, my groin!

DAVID ASHE:
What?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Ow, my groin.

DAVID ASHE:
Do you know anyone who does a worse Rich Evans than you?
My god.
This guy can do a better Rich Evans.

RICH:
I think we can work with this.

JOE VACCARIELO:
This guy was doing a good Joe Vacc!

RICH:
I can't audition for Joe Vacc.
I can't.

C.C. CHAPMAN:
Okay.
It's a time to chill.

JOE VACCARIELO:
It's a time to chill.
I'll do the movie if you give me the hookers.

JAY:
Wait, wait, wait.
We're talking about hookers here?
Where are the hookers?
Do we have...
There are no hookers?

JOE VACCARIELO:
Oh, shit.

DAVID ASHE:
If you get the party, you get hookers.

RICH:
I'm a hooker.

JAY:
Am I a...

DAVID ASHE:
There are too many bagels!

RICH:
When all else fails...
Oh!
I've fallen down!
I've fallen...
Oh!

GARRETT:
That's Rich Evans.
That's not Joe Vacc.

RICH:
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
Now fall up.
Fall up!

RICH:
Oh!
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
That's terrible.

LISA:
Go, Rich!

JAY:
Hello, Heather.

LISA:
What's up, Jim?

JAY:How was your first semester of college?

LISA:
Uh, not too bad.

JAY:
Really?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
What were you studying in?

LISA:
I was studying in film.

JAY:
Film?
Really?

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
Did you watch any interesting films?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
Not one?
I got a gun.

LISA:
Oh, my god!

JAY:
No, that's not threatening.
I was just telling you that I had a gun.

LISA:
Oh, you just had...
Okay.

JAY:
Yeah.

LISA:
Okay.

JAY:
Do you want to hold the gun?

LISA:
No.

GARRETT:
And...action.

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
I'm a loose cannon.

JASON SANTO:
But you get the job done.

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
I'm off the case.

JAY:
Henry, this is Heather.
Heather is in college.

LISA:
Nice to meet you, Henry.

MIKE:
Oh, Heather.

LISA:
Hi.

MIKE:
I've read so much about you.

LISA:
Yes.
What have you heard?

JAY:
Where did you read something about her at?

MIKE:
Your book on beetles.

LISA:
Yes.

JAY:
Oh, the beetle book.
I totally forgot you wrote that.

LISA:
The first edition.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Chapter four.
How to eat beetles with macaroni salad.

LISA:
Did you like that one, or...
Have you tried it?

MIKE:
I tried it, and I vomited.
All over myself and others.

LISA:
It's not for everyone, but...

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
Can we assign me an off-beat partner?
Maybe a dog that drools a lot?

JASON SANTO:
Your new partner's over here.

MAN WITH GLASSES:
But I don't like any of you.

JONASON HO:
Why, I think it's all fucked.
Fucked.
Fucked.
Fucked.
And fucked.

JASON SANTO:
That's where you're wrong my friend.

JONASON HO:
Am I?
Am I?

JASON SANTO:
That's where you're wrong, my friend!
That's where you're wrong!

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
Aughhh!

MIKE:
So, I read something.

JAY:
You said...
You said you'd...

MIKE:
Excuse me.
So I hear there's some ghosts around.

LISA:
Really?
I hadn't heard that yet.

JAY:
Wait, what?
Ghosts?

LISA:
Ghosts.

MIKE:
It's the legend here in this town, is that an old ghost who used to be a miner is coming back to mine.

JASON SANTO:
Drop the case.

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
I'm off the case.

JASON SANTO:
You're off the case.

JONASON HO:
So sad.
So sad.
Your dad will be very mad.

JASON SANTO:
Poor bastard.

MAN WITH GLASSES:
I don't like this.
I don't like any of us.
I don't like me.
I don't like any...

JONASON HO:
Shut the fuck up!

JASON SANTO:
Crap.

MAN WITH GLASSES:
I don't like your tone of voice.

JONASON HO:
Shut up!
Why don't you get together...

JASON SANTO:
Crap.

JONASON HO:
Well, maybe you guys can work in a cell a little better or something.
A loose cannon.
I mean, so what?
There's a lot of things...
You know what I'm saying?
So you guys should just get together and have, like, a barbeque or something.
And things will be okay.

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
I'm a loose cannon.

JASON SANTO:
But you get the job done.

JONASON HO:
Cocksucker.
Cocksucking what?
Sucker?
Fuck you.

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
I'm a loose cannon.

JASON SANTO:
But you get results.

MAN WITH SIDEBURNS:
Look!
He's doing something bad!

JONASON HO:
That's one fucked up dude right there.

JASON SANTO:
Crap.

MIKE:
Listen, um...
I've got some birdwatching to do.

JAY:
Hey, Heather.

LISA:
What's up, Jim?

JAY:
Hey, Heather.

LISA:
What's up, Jim?

JAY:
I'm gonna go over there now.

MIKE:
Garrett, this is terible.

LISA:
Garrett, is this what you wanted?
It's terr...

DAVID ASHE:
All right.
Welcome.
We've called you out here for the audition for...

GARRETT:
Thank you.

DAVID ASHE:
Don't talk.
We've called you out here for the audition for Some Call It Cum.

GARRETT:
I'm gonna be a porno Jesus.

DAVID ASHE:
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Okay.
Okay.

GARRETT:
You're shooting a movie?
My name is Garrett Gilchrist.
I make movie.
See, I say "movie" like a cow.
I've got a company called Orange Cow Productions.
We make moo-vies.
I'm from Monroe, Connecticut.
The film capital of the world.

DAVID ASHE:
Are you willing to take your shirt off?

GARRETT:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
No!
Don't!
Please!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Uh, you're very good.
Uh, we like what you're doing.
Uh, that's...

GARRETT:
I make Star Wars movies.
I've got a light-'em-a-saber.
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Moo-vace.
I like Phantom Menace.
This was the greatest of the Star Wars films.
I was not in this film.
We made a movie in my backyard about The Phantom Menace.
It was called The Phantom Movie.

DAVID ASHE:
Shut up.

GARRETT:
Phantom Moo-vie.
I...
Is this a porno?

DAVID ASHE:
Wait.
Hold on.

GARRETT:
Is this a porno?
My mother doesn't let me do pornos.

DAVID ASHE:
Don't talk.

GARRETT:
I was in a Jay Bauman movie.
I played Jesus.
I was fucking a girl.
Something I've never done in actual real life.
But it was fun.
That's why they call it acting.

DAVID ASHE:
Shut up.

GARRETT:
That's why they call it acting.

DAVID ASHE:
Look, um...
Don't, don't talk, all right?

GARRETT:
Okay.

DAVID ASHE:
Do you have a scene prepared for us?

GARRETT:
Yeah?
No?
Yeah.
I have prepared a scene from the greatest motion picture ever written: Excaliburger (or, the Spatula in the Stone).
Okay.
Here's how it goes.
"I'm not your squire!"
"You're my squire!"
"You got that?"

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, my god.
This is...

GARRETT:
"My voice isn't irritating!"
Okay.
In that scene, the bush was playing Michelle Caruso, who was in my movie Excaliburger (or, the Spatula in the Stone), who is up for Best Supporting Actress at the Retard Video Awards in South Demakota, the film capital of the world.
Besides Monroe, Connecticut, of course.
I lost part of my...

DAVID ASHE:
Mr. Gilchrist, um...
A contemporary of yours, uh, Mr. Guy McConnell, has called you one of the hottest up-and-coming filmmakers in the industry.
What do you have to say about that?

GARRETT:
He thinks I'm sexy?
I wish...

DAVID ASHE:
Um...

GARRETT:
He thinks I'm sexy?
He's, he's the first person who's ever called me sexy.
I don't know want to sound like a queer or nothing, but Guy McConnell's hot.
I make movies!
See, it's "moo-vies" like a cow!
For Orange Cow Productions!

DAVID ASHE:
Uh, we got that.
Look, um...
Do you have any, uh, plans for the immediate future of your filmmaking career?

GARRETT:
Yes.
I am making a serious four-hour character drama about life and love in Los Angeles.
I make movies!
I am a serious film-a ma-maker.

DAVID ASHE:
Wow.
That's...
I bet your mother's very proud of you.

GARRETT:
My mother beats me.
Hard.
With pieces of the toilet.

DAVID ASHE:
Um...
Could you, could you get that out of your mouth.

GARRETT:
You're cute.

DAVID ASHE:
Um...
Please don't hump that.
Please.

GARRETT:
What?

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.

GARRETT:
I've got a light-a-ma-saber.
I like women.

DAVID ASHE:
We all do.

GARRETT:
Women give me erect-a-mions.

DAVID ASHE:
Oh, my...

GARRETT:
Where am I?
Where the fuck is this?

DAVID ASHE:
Why don't you go wander around for a while?
I bet you'll find some treasure.

GARRETT:
I love Jesus.

DAVID ASHE:
Thank god he's going.
Call in the next guy.

GARRETT:
The hills are alive with the sound of moo-vies.

DAVID ASHE:
You know what?
Just fuck it.
Give me the handgun.
Oh, he's coming back...
Fuck.
Um...
Hey.
Look over there!
It's, uh...
Oh, god.
He's coming behind the table.
Don't, don't touch me there.
Oh, my god!
That's your pe-...
Oh, my god!

GARRETT:
I like women.

DAVID ASHE:
Something funny about the wilderness.
It brings out everything you hate about yourself.
I stare at the rocks, and you know what I see?
I see myself with a huge erection.
Well, no.
I don't see that.
Well, I see that, too.
What I see is black.
The blackness of man's hearts.
I just started with me wearing lingeries.
I didn't think it would turn into this.
John.
John.
What are you building?
They outlawed machines for a reason, John.
Do you want another war?
What are branches looking for?
Why do they branch out?
What the fuck do they want?
It's coming.
Inspiration.
The greatest story I've ever heard.
Yes, I can see it all now.
Cinema.
Theater.
Novels.
Yes.
It'll be about sand.
It's so clear now.
I'll make millions.
All on sand.
If only they knew it was just millions of little grains.
It's not just sand.
I just want my uncle to love me.
Why did he do those things?
I didn't wanna play Risk.
He always got South America.
South America was my favorite.
And I never did understand what the cannon pieces were for.
You know what my father used to say?
A hatchet is never just a hatchet.
It's so many things.
A weapon.
A tool
An anniversary gift.
Eww.
Oh, that's really nasty.
I think I'll do it again.
Tastes like pineapple.
I could really go for some pineapple.
Do you think there's any pineapple in those bushes, John?
Huh?
You're precious bushes that you don't want me to hurt?
Well, maybe you should've done a better job of protecting them.
Man, that's yellow.
Nothing like a good yellow piss.
So what are we cooking here?
You know what really pisses me off, John?
When things don't work like they're supposed to.
It makes me really mad, John.

JOHN BRUGMANN:
Hey.
Hey.
Stop it.
Stop...
Aw, geez.

DAVID ASHE:
I just wanted to make some art.
Isn't this so pretty?
Too bad it doesn't bleed, because blood is really pretty.
You know what really pisses me off, John?
When people don't like my art.
That really gets my bear.
It really gets my bear!
Oh, god!
A bear!
An innocent little rock.
You know how the human heart can be.
Even rocks aren't safe from evil.
Man, I suck at evil.
It's not easy being insane.
It's really hard to scare others sometime.
It makes me cry.
It makes me weep.
I think I just can't go on.
But then I remember something a friend once told me.
Satan, yeah!
Yeah, he's Satan.
Yeah.
He made me do lots of evil deeds.
Yes, Satan!
He's freaking Sat-, Sat-, Sat-, Sat-, Satan.
He's my friend.
One day I was walking down the street.
Walk, walk, walk, walk.
I was walking down the street.
Yeah, yeah.
And who comes up to me but Mr. Satan?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan.
What did he say to me?
He said...
"Hey, hey jackass."
"Pull up your pants."
"Don't touch yourself there."
"There's more important things in life for you."
"You?"
"Yes, evil!"
Evil is what you need.
You gotta give in.
You gotta give in.
You gotta give in.
Gotta give in to Satan!
Yes, Sat-, Sat-, Sat-...
Sat-freaking-an.
He's evil!

GARRETT:
Wait a minute.
My psychic superpowers have detected a terrible evil.
Somebody is making a sequel to Ghostbusted!
No-o-o-o-o!
That's the sound of my head exploding.
And...action!
Rich, run!
You're action-packed.

RICH:
I'm here to kill you.

DAVID ASHE:
And I'm here to kill you.

RICH:
Jimmy sent me.

DAVID ASHE:
Wait a minute.
They set us up to kill each other.

RICH:
Jimmy sent us to kill each other as part of a complicated plot.
What was he gonna do if I shot you and you died, and then you couldn't shoot me?
I think Jimmy's plot is flawed.

DAVID ASHE:
Let's go.

RICH:
Do we really need to bother?

DAVID ASHE:
No, let's go, uh...

RICH:
We can get some bagels.

DAVID ASHE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Okay.

DAVID ASHE:
I like bagels.

RICH:
Oh!
Oh!

DAVID ASHE:
Ah!
Fuck!
You asshole!
You just shot me!
Goddamitt!

RICH:
You know, I'm a professional.

DAVID ASHE:
Gimme that, you goddamn asshole.
How do you like it?

RICH:
Ow!
My groin!

DAVID ASHE:
That's not your...

RICH:
Oh, heart!
Heart!
Ow, my heart!

DAVID ASHE:
Shit.
Fuck.

RICH:
You son of a bitch.
I'm giving you the Gods of L.A. now.

DAVID ASHE:
I don't want that crap.

RICH:
Here.

DAVID ASHE:
Get it away from me.

RICH:
Why aren't we dying?

DAVID ASHE:
I don't know.

RICH:
I don't feel inured anymore.
I think I'm okay.

DAVID ASHE:
I'm feeling nauseous.

RICH:
Okay.
Oh, no!

DAVID ASHE:
You still wanna get a bagel?

RICH:
Yeah.

DAVID ASHE:
Let's, let's go get a bagel.

LISA:
Go, Rich!

JAY:
Yay, Rich!

LISA:
All right!

JAY:
It's one year later, Rich!

LISA:
Whoo!

JAY:
I now have a gun and a basketball.
Oh!
Joe!
What are you doing here, Joe?

MIKE:
Hi.
Hi.
I know.

JAY:
I bought this for you.

MIKE:
Oh, thanks
You know, I found that ghost.

JAY:
That ghost that you told us about one year ago?

LISA:
I think...
Yeah, last year you said something about...

MIKE:
He came right out riding out on his translucent horse.
He got off and went towards the...
And I pulled...

JAY:
What kind of horse was it?

LISA:
It was translucent.
How fun.

MIKE:
Fear me.
Anyways.
Um...
What's, what's been going on with you two?

LISA:
Not very much.

JAY:
You're still in school?
Is it still for film?

LISA:
Yeah.

JAY:
Have you watched anything interesting yet?

LISA:
No.

JAY:
Not one?

MIKE:
You know, I was on, on the underground railroad.

JAY:
Really.

LISA:
You've never said that before.

JAY:
You never told me about that, Joe.

MIKE:
Well, I, I, I was the conductor.
