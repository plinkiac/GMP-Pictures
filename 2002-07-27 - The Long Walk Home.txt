Hello, Jackie.
I turned in my badge a few days ago.
I know you think I'm probably overreacting.
Well, not this time.
It's just, the force was overrun with corruption.
It was hard to say no.
I got in too deep. 
[Contreras] double-crossed me.
He killed you because of me.
I miss seeing your face in the morning.
I miss waking up next to you.
Paul.
Paul is only eight years old.
Gunter.
I see your wife is in one of these graves.
A lesson, perhaps.
You'd be in one, too, if you didn't like the work that you did for us.
Go ahead and shoot me, Gunther.
It seems to be what you do best.
You got greedy, Jack.
Don't make the same mistake as your wife.
The only thing I'm greedy for is revenge.
If you're gonna shoot me, now's your chance.
The night is cold.
The sidewalk seemed to stretch on forever.
How was I gonna do this?
How was I gonna cross the Triad long enough to see justice served?
They say a good cop should always do his duty.
His job is to uphold the truth.
To protect the and to serve.
They say you should never cross that thin blue line.
What happens when they cross that line?
Well, I cross back.
But, now, my back's up against the wall, and it's just me against the whole world.
There's still a few souls who will help me out.
Now is the perfect time to call in a few favors.
Yeah, well, I look like shit because I feel like shit.
Jack, I called you about something you might find very interesting.
Jack, don't open it right now.
You might want to be sitting down.
Dave.
I just want you to know how much this means to me.
Ever since I had to leave the force, nobody even talks to me anymore.
Makes me wonder how far this goes on.
You have no idea.
Jack, are you sure that you wanna do this?
They killed my family, Dave.
I don't have anything to live for anymore.
I'll die trying to bring these men down.
Look, Dave.
I could really use your help on this one.
Jack, I can't.
I got the documents for you, and it's the last I can do.
Jack, I just can't.
I have a family of my own.
And if I were you, I'd get out, too.
But I guess you wouldn't.
Jack, I have to go back into the party.
Senator Johnson's looking for me. 
I'm sorry.
Dave.
Dave!
The fuck.
The fuck.
He was supposed to be here, like, 15 minutes ago.
Where the fuck is he?
I dunno.
The cops fucking know who killed his family.
I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing here.
The only reason I got involved with this shit was to get me and my fucking girlfriend out of this fucking hellhole.
We got no money.
Your girlfriend's cute, right?
What the fuck did you say about my girlfriend?
Why don't you put the gun down, Jim?
If you didn't notice, my name is Reg Heart, and I got an itchy trigger finger.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm a fucking bank teller, man.
I screwed everything up.
We fucking crossed the Triad.
Are any of you up for something?
I can't go back to jail.
I'll do anything.
I'll wear a wire.
I'll wear a wire.
I can't go back to jail.
I'll do anything.
I'll help you get Ramirez.
I"ll wear a wire.
Are you sure you don't wanna keep playing the game?
What about him?
If I shoot him, I might get caught.
I'm not.
You are now depressing me with your service.
Hey, listen.
I'm doing my best.
You're best will need to get better if you plan on living longer.
Hey, I told ya.
I don't respond to threats.
Threats make my business run smoothly.
Now, tell me about the cop.
Like I said before, this guy's fucking everything up.
We have the whole police force on the take.
But once we got Senator Johnson's vote, this guy began...well, he began interfering.
Hmm...we'll have to kill him.
Yeah, I mean, killing his wife and kids just made him more determined to stop this operation.
But a word out.
The cop must die.
Yeah, I used to work for the Triads.
It's no secret.
I was a dirty cop.
Jackie, she never knew.
It was my dirty little secret.
I guess that's what killed her in the end.
She never knew what hit her.
I took the easy path.
The shortcut through life.
But, you know what?
Redemption is a hard, rocky road.
And it's a long, long walk home.
