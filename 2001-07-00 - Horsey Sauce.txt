Woah.
Hey, Hey.
Oh, oh.
They got horsey sauce here.
Come again?
What was that?
They've got horsey sauce.
See, they got the ketchup.
And then they got the horsey sauce.
The horsey sauce.
Horsey sauce.
Don't you mean horseradish?
No, no, no.
Horsey sauce.
I am confused.
Horseradish and horsey sauce are the same thing?
Not horseradish.
They got horsey sauce.
Horsey sauce.
Horsey sauce.
Stop saying horsey sauce.
What?
Horsey sauce.
What?
And ketchup.
And ketchup, too.
They got ketchup and the horsey sauce.
What?
No, ketchup.
What?
Horsey sauce.
Horsey sauce.
And then they got the horsey sauce.
Horsey sauce.
What?
Eddie, what are you doing?
You should not be riding the dinosaur.
It is for the kids.
It is not a real dinosaur.
It is a fake, fiberglass impression of one with paint on it, and a mechanical motorized vehicle engine.
Oh, I am sorry.
I didn't realize that.
Maybe you should speak before you think.
