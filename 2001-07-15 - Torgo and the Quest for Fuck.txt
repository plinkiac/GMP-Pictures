Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
Nice night.
Yeah.
You can't really see the stars, but I'm sure they're there.
Your eyes are beautiful like stars.
Thank you.
Calm down.
Do you live here?
Are you a woman of this town?
Yes.
I'm just, I'm waiting for my friend.
She's, like, an hour-and-a-half away.
I'm just waiting for a ride.
Oh, my god.
Would you like a ride?
We could provide a ride.
I'm good, I'm good.
Look, I just--
Do you live here?
Do you come here often?
What is your sign?
Yes.
Don't, don't, don't let him bother you.
Is he a robot?
No, he's not a robot.
Listen, I got some lip, some lip balm.
That's nice.
You, you look, you look a little, you look a little chapped.
I'm not chapped, thank you very much.
Well, if you, listen, if you want a ride, our, our, our room, it's just across the street right there.
You can just go in.
I'm good.
I have this brother.
He's this little boy, but nice.
I'm really, I'm fine.
I mean, I can just.
We are trying to help him.
We need your help.
Only you--
I'm fine!
She'll be here.
You can help him.
We can provide a ride!
We can help you!
Was that appropriately ac--
Shut the door, shut the door.
What have we done?
Penelope, Penelope, listen.
It's going to be all right.
Oh, shit.
I am always so uncomfortable around women.
Okay.
Okay. 
It's okay.
Look.
It's okay.
It's not a gas chamber, it's a fucking room.
Calm down.
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
Sit down.
We, we're not here to hurt you.
We just need your help.
Everything's going to be fine.
Okay.
It'll all be fine.
Hey.
Once you meet Torgo.
Listen, listen, okay?
I just wanted to ask you a favor, eh.
I want, I want you to meet somebody.
I want you to meet Torgo.
My brother Torgo.
To think, he always looks down at me.
I'll cut to the chase.
Torgo's 22.
He's way past the point he should've lost his virginity, right?
I was, I lost mine at 13.
But it's not his fault.
Women don't find him attractive.
I don't know why.
I find him attractive.
It's not his fault.
Torgo was born...a little lopsided.
Oval.
If normal's a circle, then Torgo's a little oblong.
So?
Torgo, quiet!
Don't make me get out the fire stick again!
Torgo, I'll get you some corn ice cream, and you calm down, okay?
You like ice cream, don't you?
With corn, it's his favorite.
You like corn ice cream.
All I want...I want you to make love to Torgo.
What?
No, it's, let me explain.
He's a good boy.
It's okay.
He's a little drooly.
See, that's a little bit of Torgo.
Oh, my god.
Please let me go.
Ow.
You'll like him.
My grapes are mushed.
Come back here!
Come back here, and love Torgo!
Please!
Come back!
I need you!
Ow!
I can pay you.
What the fuck is that?
Don't worry about it, honey.
It's just two people screwing around.
Don't, don't sweat it.
Shit like that happens all the time around here.
It's okay, it's okay.
My groin!
Ow!
Torgo needs you.
I need you.
Ow!
Jesus, my fucking leg again.
Ow!
She's getting away.
Who am I talking to?
She really gooched my beanbag, Torgo.
She got away.
Damn this mechanical leg of mine.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Torgo, I'm afraid you may not get laid this decade, either.
It's your turn to jerk him off, dude.
Oh, no.
I did it yesterday.
Thrice!
It's your turn again, man.
Shitballs.
All right, Torgo.
Sit down on the bed.
You know how he hates those calloused hands.
Uh...I think I have the wrong room.
Oh, that's okay, dude.
Come on guys, come in.
Come on, big guy.
Hey, no, no, no.
Come on, guys, I want you to meet my brother, Torgo.
I have a proposition for you.
I want you to make love to Torgo.
No?
